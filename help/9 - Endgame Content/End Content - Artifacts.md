Before the time of Legends, there lived a proud race of people who were skilled in the crafting of items, weapons and armor.

The Arterians as they were known, were few in number and usually lived in isolated settlements as such the rarity and workmanship of Arterian items were second to none and widely sought after.

Unfortunately it seems the Arterians eventually died out, and their superior crafting skills were thought to have died with them until a series of detailed crafting plans were uncovered in the bowels of the Legend dungeons.

It seems the Legend Dungeons were built ontop of Arterian camps and as such the dungeons may still contain Arterian technology. Most people now refer to these items as Artifacts and they are still extremely prized.

**Imbuements**  
A good friend of Elwick the Legend Historian has come to stay for a while, Alerion the Wise has unearthed some interesting research into Imbuements.

He can for a fee of 5pp per item imbue any Artifacts you may have in your possession with a special spell, this spell is much like an Inscription or a Poison in that you can only have an Inscription or a Poison or an Imbuement on an item you can not mix and match one of each.

Imbuements bestow a debuff effect on a target that lasts the entire fight and can stack multiple times. Imbuements have a 22% chance of firing.

Go to 53, 41 Royal Hollow to speak to Alerion and imbue your Artifacts.
