The Battlefield has long been a place for a man or woman to prove themselves as such the Myzan Battlefield is an area of contested land that is fought over more vigorously than all of the other lands.

While the Reaper war is nothing but a few years old, the battlefield was the site of an ancient conflict perhaps going as far back as the Legends of Myzan, many great battles have been fought there since and many more shall be fought there in the times to pass.

_The battlefield is only accessible to those that have chosen a side, if you are neutral you may not take part in the battlefield, only those of Exile, Society or Reaper blood can enter. To access the battlefield you must have completed all of the allegiance outpost quests, some 100 or so quests in total that were given out by outpost commanders across all 10 realms and starting in Knotwood Valley at level 50._

If you have completed all of these quests your allegiance leader in the Royal Hollow will grant you access to the battlefield!

The battlefield is infact 16 different areas of a map, each area has 3 outposts and one Keep. The keep is locked and secure and can only be entered if your allegiance holds the 3 outposts on that area of the map.

_To take an outpost you must siege it but be warned the outposts revert back to the original allegiance after one hour._

Once your allegiance owns all three outposts you can enter the keep, inside the keep you will find a Flag which you must click on to finalise the taking of the keep (if you do not click on the flag then you have not captured the keep). In this way even if your allegiance loses an outpost if someone does not take the flag you still own the keep.

Also within the keep you will find a "Seller of Legendary Weapons" NPC who will sell you legendary weapons for 20 Legend Tokens. Each keep has a different NPC who sells different weapon types inside so you will need to find the right NPC for your chosen weapon type.

If you are not sure what outposts go to what keep there is an easy way to find out, go stand on the tile that has the Keep you want on it then goto the World > Map screen, the map will display the current area and will show the three outposts you need to take.

You can also use the World > Maps > Allegiances screen to view the Areas and Keeps your allegiance currently controls.

The more keeps that your allegiance owns the more rewards they receive, allegiance rewards can be manually activated via the Abilities > Allegiances screen.

There are 400 spells split into 4 groups, spells for Intelligence, Dexterity, Speed and Strength. Essentially 100 spells for each of those 4 stats, each spell is designed for a different Level so even low level players can get the rewards of the higher levels taking keeps.

You may not have two of the same type of spell on, i.e. you can not have two Intelligence allegiance rewards on but you can have one of each Intelligence, Dexterity, Speed and Strength at the same time.
