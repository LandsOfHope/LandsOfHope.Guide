If any of you have ever done the Challenge or the JW realm, you know that in general you need to prepare for it to do well, this new realm is no different to that.

The monsters in the new realm are all extremely nasty critters with much higher stats than most, perhaps even higher than the Devourer. They may also get Demonstones and once I add bosses you may end up fighting several monsters at once ... yes that is evil but you know you love me!

Checklist for preparing:

*   Get as many pieces of your equipment to level 995 or 1000 (remember level 1000 materials are now in) as you can.
    *   Artifact weapons and Legend armor recommended for players
    *   Good weapons and level 1000 armor for pets
    *   Inscribe all weapons with damage spells and/or imbuements, and try to use bejewels or patches to boost effectiveness.
*   Make sure you have a mount (for the +20% health and +% evade bonuses)
*   If you are a fighter class and your pet is weaker than you, make sure your pet has taunting turned off and if possible you should turn your taunting on so you get all of the attacks, you will live longer than your pet anyways.
*   If you have buff spells available to you either from your mount, your class or from your allegiance (Abilities > Allegiance), make sure this are activated. Even set bonuses from Legend gear should be activated if possible.
*   Make sure you have enough stamina to do your combat styles, and that your pet has learnt the best styles it can use if it is melee based.
*   Make sure you have enough mana and intelligence to do your best spells, and your pet has enough to use its best spells if it is caster based.
*   Make sure you rest after changing gear ... (either for you or for your pet)
*   Also if you are in an active Fellowship, this will make the monsters much much harder ... so consider leaving it.

That should pretty much cover the bases, if you do all of the above you should stand a fair chance, the monsters may get a first hit in so you should be wary of that and try to get yourself a a Demon stone as soon as possible and any of the other artifact quest items from this realm that can help.
