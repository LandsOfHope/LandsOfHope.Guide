After reaching level 1000 you can begin to gain legend tokens by completing the legend dungeons. These Legend tokens can be used to gain the legend sets of armor from Elwick and weapons from the Keeps in the Battlefield realm.

**Legend Historian**  
Elwick can be found at Elwick\`s House of History (53, 41) in the Royal Hollow realm.

When you click on Elwick you will see a screen with a bunch of different options:

*   **The Legends of Ten**, provides more indepth information of the history behind the Legends.
*   **Token Locations**, Elwick will provide you with a key to the first dungeon that you can use to travel to its location to begin the hunt for legend tokens.
*   **Redeem Tokens**, lets you use your dungeon tokens to redeem legend armor.

**Legend Dungeon Keys**  
The key you gained from Elwick and the keys you later gain from completing the dungeons can be used as teleportation devices to teleport to the location of a dungeon.

Use the Inventory > Containers > Keys screen to teleport to the location of a dungeon once you have a key.

**Redeeming Tokens**  
After successfully completing a dungeon you will unlock a series of rewards on Elwick\`s reward screen you will notice that the more dungeons you complete the more rewards become available this is intentional and requires you to actually do a lot of the dungeons before all of the rewards are available.

The reward screen itself gives you a list of all of the items that you can gain and when you click on a reward you can then turn in some of your legend tokens to gain the reward.
