Some demonstones may have not yet been found, as no one really knows where the Demonstones come from.

To use a Demonstone in combat you must first equip it, you may only use one Demon power in combat based on the Demonstone you have equipped.Â After equipping the Demonstone you should note a new button on the combat interface spell casting row, this button will activate your demon power. Once activated the power will run for the entire length of the fight with no way to shut it off.
