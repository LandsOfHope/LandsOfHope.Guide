Apparently two brand new Legends have mysteriously appeared out of nowhere into Elwick\`s history books ... gotta love magic!

Legend speaks of a Tinman, as tall as ten men and as strong as an Army. Elwick believes he has found the Tinman\`s armor.

Legend now also speaks of a mythical stitched being known as Frankenstein, a fearsome beast stitched together from old parts ... and it just so happens Elwick has found those parts.

Translation ...

I have added two new sets of armor the Tinman set and the Frankenstein set. These are unlocked as Legend Rewards via Historian Elwick.

Key of the Third (Tinman)Â and Key of the Seventh (Frankenstein) required.
