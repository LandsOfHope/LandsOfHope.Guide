So you bought the expansion pack ... good on ya!

First things first, head over to springlade and click on the Jurassic Wars portal to transport yourself to Juratania, if you havent done so already of course.

**Camp Eversight**  
You will start out in the Eversight Expedition camp at 43, 71 (the main outpost in the realm), you can check out the other key locations by using the World > Landmarks screen.

If you wish to learn the new Patchcrafting skill I suggest you visit the Patchmasters Tent at Camp Eversight, Camp Eversight also has the Eversight Quatermaster for giving out armor rewards, a Riding Trainer which lets you ride the strange beasts you might tame in Juratania and also many other quests and such to complete.

The main quests from all of the NPCs in Juratania involve collecting trophy items, these typically show up green on monsters so if you come across trophy items DO NOT SELL them as you will be shooting yourself in the foot, keep them safe and you will find completing quests relatively easy.

You may also find Expedition Crates and Bags, the bags are more common and can be used in turn-in quests with Eversight, the Crates are rarer and therefore more valuable and can be turned in to Commander Eversight to earn yourself a 60 slot bag the Eversight Bag, or used to earn Marks of Eversight.

The Mark of Eversight is a type of currency that NPCs deal with in any of the Expedition outposts, they can be used to buy goods and items and are very valuable!

There are four other Expedition camps, each one has quests for you to do to earn Expedition crates/bags and Marks.

**Spirit Druids Grotto**  
This is a special place for Druids, Diviner, Wardens and Hermits, it has quests and taks specifically for you to do and no one else can access them. Also if you are a Druid you can enter the Dark Druid portal and learn the ways of Darkness by forsaking your Druid magic and learning Poison magic instead.

There are several turn-in style quests here for you to do, and you earn Seeds of Mosslord which are used to trade for goods and services (namely your Druid set of gear which is an awesome looking set of items).

**Dragons Bay**  
Another outpost this time filled with natives to the lands and not interlopers, the Dragonkin are a proud warrior race but are in trouble and need your help. Doing quests for Queen Drakmar will earn you Scales of Drakmar which can be turned in to gain special trinkets and rings.

Other things to do ...

Well If the gather quests dont take your fancy you can always just kill monsters to your hearts content, there are no gatherable resources in Juratania so you will have to return to normal realms to raise any gathering skills you might have.

There are a whole host of new monsters that can be tamed by Beastmasters and Druids, including Dragonflyers, Raptors and more .... some of these new races are rideable but you must first unlock a tamed mounts riding ability by speaking to the Saddlemaker NPC at Camp Eversight.

As you wander around you may find mushrooms on the ground, you should pick these up as they offer a special spell effect and also can be used in quests and such.

Also you may find Questors when wandering around, these NPCs will reward you with money and marks when you take them to where they want to go and may offer insights into the land you might not find any other way.
