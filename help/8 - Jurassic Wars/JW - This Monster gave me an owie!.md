As you have probably noticed the monsters in Juratania are not weak and feeble like the monsters in the other realms, they are ferocious beasts that like nothing more enjoyable than ripping your still beating heart out and dipping it in bbq sauce before eating it.

So be prepared, check your equipment before fighting them make sure you are using the best you can use for your level ... that means if you are level 50 using level 5 gear you need to go get new gear.

The monsters have three difficulty settings which are chosen randomly the difficulty of the monster can be determined by looking at the name of the monster on the main screen, a monster with a bigger name (font size) is tougher than a monster with a smaller name.

The Mushrooms you find lying around may give you a bit of an edge so feel free to experiment with them to find ones that help you kick monster bootie.
