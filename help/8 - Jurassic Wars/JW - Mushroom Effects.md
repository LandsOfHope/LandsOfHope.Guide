x and y are both variable depending on your level when using the item. There are 11 different versions of each effect so as you level up you will notice a more powerful spell may be used when consuming a mushroom.

_Please note this is a video game, and while the mushrooms in the game are edible we do not recommend digging up mushrooms and fungi in the real world and eating it._
