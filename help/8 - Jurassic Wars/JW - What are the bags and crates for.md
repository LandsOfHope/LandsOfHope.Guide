Bags and Crates are items the big chief, Commander Eversight or CE to his buddies wants you to return.

The camp has been hit by animal attacks several times and each time they lose more and more supplies, also caravans bringing new supplies are hit on a regular basis and monsters seem to take curious pride in guarding the bags and crates in a fashion that prevents them from being easily recovered.

You can return 100 eversight bags to get one mark of eversight, marks of eversight can then be used to get equipment from the Quartermaster NPC.

Eversight Crates are rarer than bags, and ultimately more valuable, you can turn in less of them than bags to get a mark of eversight ... they can also be turned in to CE to gain an Eversight Bag which is the biggest bag in the game.

Returning Crates and Bags can be repeated multiple times, but you can only get an Eversight Bag once.

Killing monsters and doing quests are the ways in which you find the bags and crates so what are you doing reading this topic, go out there and killlllllllllll!
