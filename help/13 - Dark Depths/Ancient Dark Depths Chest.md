In the Dark Depths you will come across treasure chests .... yay!

These chests are called "Ancient Dark Depths Chests" which is a very imaginative name, that took me many days to come up with.

These chestsÂ are found on the ground and can be looted only after you have killed the monster on that tile (if there is a monster).

There are a number of different items you can get from the chest, and if you have a Red Control Crystal you will get better items.

The known list includes:

*   Ancient cloak
*   Ancient treasure box
*   Gold coin
*   Dark Depths Journal
*   Ancient Powder Box
*   Ancient Serpentine bracelet
*   Scroll of Wisdom

Any items you do not want can be recycled at a Recyclatron (Pink Control Crystal required to access) and you will stand a chance of getting a powder back.

There is also a low chance the box will be empty, or the box is something a tad nastier in disguise!
