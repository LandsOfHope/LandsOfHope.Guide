A long time ago the Arterans one of the ancient races (Eternal Plains) were instructed to hide something within a place no one could ever find it.  
  
For centuries what was actually hidden has been lost, some speculate it was a treasure the likes of which any King would seek, while others think for it to have been hidden for so long whatever it was must have been dangerous.  
  
All that is truly known is that the Arterans built a massive dungeon with this "thing" hidden somewhere at the center.  
  
The Dark Depths as the locals later came to call it consists of at least 10 known layers, and over the years generations of races have sought both refuge and riches in the depths ... even today some of the older races still lay claim to many of its corridors ... they may not consider outsiders in a friendly light.  
  
Will you be one of the first to enter the Dark Depths and reach the Center to unlock the lost secrets or will you die trying?
