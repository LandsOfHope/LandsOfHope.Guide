Within the Afterlife you will find the Darkness, this is not some ordinary darkness that you find in dark places of your house this is the combination of thousands of dead souls merged together in conscious hatred and evilness!

No one knows when the Darkness was formed but they do know it grows on a daily basis as hatred and evilness spreads through the land.

What is clear however is that the Darkness is responsible for creating the Undead monsters that later went on to form the Reapers, although not directly affiliated with the Reapers the Darkness could be considered the mother of all Reapers.

**How to turn the lights on?**  
At 20, 58 you will find the Darkness, it is a level 2000 monster with approximately 100,000 health ... the only way to defeat this beast is to weaken it by using the Darkness Quencher inside the same location. You will need special Crystals of Light which can be gained as quest rewards to weaken the Darkness and you will need the help of up to three other players who will also need to weaken the Darkness before you can kill it.

Anyone who places a Crystal of Light for a spawned darkness will receive a reward item no matter who kills the Darkness.

Killing the Darkness will add 2000 fresh kills to the Lifestream, so the more times the spirits the Darkness is made from are released the harder normal monsters become.

**The Grail**  
The Grail is the reward given by the Knights Templar for turning in the bit of darkness, the Grail is a magical item which can be used from your inventory and provides a special magical effect. You can choose the effect you want the Grail to execute, with no more than one grail effect allowed on at anyone time (you can cancel one grail effect to execute another).

Effects include:

*   +2000 Health
*   +2000 Intelligence
*   +2000 Stamina
*   +2000 Speed and Dexterity
*   +1000 Experience Bonus
*   +2000 Detect Hidden
*   +2000 Stealth

This is quite a complex quest to complete to receive the bonus so good luck.
