This is a special Artifact weapon that was created based on an idea by Mamba (after she won the 2008 Auction of Promises to have an Artifact weapon added).

It is a fist weapon, with INT, STR, STA and HEALTH and also a 5% bane to the undeads that spawn in the Afterlife realm.

This weapon does not drop as a plan from Legend Dungeons, the only way to get this weapon is as follows:

- 1 in 10,000 chance of a drop from a level 1000 monster in the Afterlife if there are 10,000 or more kills in the Lifestream.
- 1 in 1,000 chance of a drop from a level 1000 monster in the Afterlife if there are 20,000 or more kills in the Lifestream.
