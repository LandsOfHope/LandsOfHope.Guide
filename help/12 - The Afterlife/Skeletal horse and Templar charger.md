These are two buyable extra pets priced reasonably at 10USD (2HC) they can be bought via the File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items screen.

Alternatively if you own the Afterlife expansion pack there will be some long winded item turn in quest to get these for free however it will likely involve many thousands of resources and selling your soul to the debil to gain ... that way you can either pay for them and get them right away or quest for them and truly get your reward from an epic struggle!
