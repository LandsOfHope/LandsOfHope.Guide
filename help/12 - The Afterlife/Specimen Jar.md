An NPC (who shall not be named due to the fact it invovles a complicated quest) can give empty specimen jars (they last 10 hours). To use a specimen jar you must first kill a monster then choose the Specimen Trap option on the loot screen.

Once you place a specimen in a specimen jar you will need to return it to the same NPC.
