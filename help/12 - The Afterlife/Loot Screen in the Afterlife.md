In the Afterlife the normal Loot screen has the following changes:

*   Skinning - changed to Sever Spirit (gives a low chance of an Urn drop) otherwise a hide drops like normal.
*   Soul Trap - removed completely as all Souls go to the life stream.
*   Intercede - Will not work on these types of monsters so has been removed.
*   Blood Drain - Monsters here are all spirits so have no blood ...
*   Specimen Trap - A new non-skill based feature, after visiting a special NPC you will be able to take a specimen of the monster in an empty specimen jar.
