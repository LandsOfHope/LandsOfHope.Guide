Spirit Monsters spawn in this realm and their difficulty is based on the amount of spirits in the Lifestream.

*   < 100 kills spawns Spirit monsters
*   < 500 kills spawns Shadow monsters
*   < 2500 kills spawns Phantom monsters
*   < 10000 kills spawns Wraith monsters
*   Higher than 10000Â kills spawns Revenants

The monsters start out at roughly the same difficulty as ordinary monsters then increase in difficulty as more kills are made each day.

*   Doubling in difficulty at 5000 kills,
*   Tripling at 10,000 kills,
*   Quadrupling at 15,000 kills etc ...

So be warned as these monsters may become too much for you to deal with!
