To exit the game correctly use the File > Logout menu to log out of your current character.

_If you do not use File > Logout but simply close the game window your character will be visible in the game for 15minutes before it is automatically logged out._

Then use the Logout link on the Account screen (if it is still open) to log out of your account.
