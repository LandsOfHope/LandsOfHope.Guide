Okay so you did something extremely stupid like:

*   Made bogus game referrals so you could cheat your way to the top of the referral system to win the 3HC prize.
*   Swore, cussed out someone in chat or otherwise broke the chat rulesÂ and ignored the warnings and got yourself banned.
*   Did something else that led to warnings or an instant ban.

This doesnt happen very often but when it does some people come out with the following excuses:

*   I lent my account to my brother, sisiter, friend, father, mather, clone, robot or other so I can not be held accountable.
*   I was HAXXED by a l33t haxx0r called IhaXX3r3dy00, he infiltrated my computer using a backdoor program cunningly disguised as either a "movie", a 10000USD piece of software, a free <insert random game name> account or a cheat program to let me level to max level in every single game yet invented and any new game to come out.
*   It couldnt have been me I was off in Tibet studying to be a monk or I was not anywhere near my account at the time so a spirit must have done it.
*   I have never played your game before so I do not know how I had an account but if you unban me I will try it out and let you know if I like it.

Okay now here is how to write a proper excuse:

*   Firstly, admit you did wrong do not fabricate an excuse ... excuses are for people who feel they have not done anything wrong and indicate a total lack of respect for me and the game.
*   Secondly, apologize for what you did and ask for a second chance because you hope to make amends for the mistake.
*   Thirdly, say it will not happen again and you will be a good person from now on and not give any trouble and listen to warnings etc ....
*   Fourthly (optional). offer to pay for an account or buy an extra as security to ensure you will not make a mistake in the future. After all if you have invested money in a game you are not very likely to be an ass in it.

I think that about covers it .... good luck with those excuses!
