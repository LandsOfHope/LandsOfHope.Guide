If you want to level a tradeskill quickly a good method is to get Deconstruction skill, or Grabthars Hammer bought extra, and make anything in that tradeskill that requires 1 material and as soon as you finish your quote Deconstruct what you made to get all your materials back. This also works to get materials quickly as you can purchase items from towns and Deconstruct them to get the materials they may hold. This is a very easy method but can be expensive and time-consuming.

For ingots: Go to a Mail Armor Shop or a Plate Armor Shop and purchase alot of the armor and Deconstruct. You should get 1-25 ingots each time.

For hides: Go to a Leather Armor Shop then purchase the items and Deconstruct. You should get 1-3 hides each time.

For thread: Go to a Cloth Armor Shop then purchase the items and Deconstruct. You should get 1-20 thread each time.

For logs: Go to a General Store and purchase Bows and Deconstruct them and then Deconstruct the Stocks. You should get 1-3 logs each time. 

For planks: Go to a General Store and purcase a lot of Spades and Deconstruct, You should get about 1-18 planks each time.

Alternative items may be found which may give same materials such as: Maces, staves, and clubs also give ingots.
