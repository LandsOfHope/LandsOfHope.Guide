In the top left corner of your game window is a map of the area it is called the mini-map it is one of the ways you move around in the game.

To move click on a square on the mini-map and you will move to that location instantly as you move around the middle of the game screen will update to display the NPCs/Monsters/people, buildings and items at that location.

_If you become lost you can click the T button at the top of the screen below the minions menu to teleport back to the place you started at. (Only available while on the estate)._
