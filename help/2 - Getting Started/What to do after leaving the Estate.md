Firstly congratulations on making it this far, you are surely a special breed of player as most people falter before reaching the end of the estate.

You are now in the main game, it is a lot more open ended than the estate so you will have to get used to not straying too far from areas suited to your level.

Remember the coordinates **31, 59** as this is where the main town is for new players ... to go to coordinates type them into the box below the mini-map on the left of the screen, if you see no boxes below the mini-map you are most likely inside a building (Click the EXIT button at the bottom of the screen to exit the building).

Check list after leaving the estate:

1.  Read/Use the Stranger chest in your inventory this is a parting gift from the Stranger and may contain useful items.
2.  Click on Springlade Town building (at 31, 59) to enter the town, here you will find a General Store NPC that sells you weapons and tools (every tool you need is right there), also vendors for armor etc ... getting level 5 gear after leaving the estate is a good first step in the world.
3.  Exit Springlade Town building by clicking the exit button at the bottom of the screen, then if you are a Fighter enter the Arena building and check the fighter trainers inside to see if they can teach you any combat styles, or if you are a caster visit the Magic trainers on the same tile to see if they can teach you any new magic spells.
4.  Enter Springlade Town Building and speak to Treasurer Fineas he has a quest that you should take, after getting the quest click the EXIT button and go to 32, 58 the Traders Alliance Bank will keep you occupied for a while.

Other things you should think about doing:

*   Learn Skinning from the Skill Trainer NPC at 31, 59, this can be used when fighting monsters to get an item and extra experience after the fight ends.
*   Check the Quest Listing board at 31, 59 for quests to do if you are tired of the Alliance Bank

**Remember to use 31, 59 to get back to Springlade as it has healers and such!**
