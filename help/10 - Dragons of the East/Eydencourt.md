Eydencourt at 50, 50 is the main neutral town in the Eastern Lands, it is where you go to choose your dragon faction and it also has a number of special trophy quests.

There are quests here for jewelry, potions, armor and other things ... to complete most of these quests you need a "court coin" this is a special item that Eydencourt uses as payment and indicates you have performed a service/deed for someone at the town. The Banker NPC outside can provide a court coin by completing one of his trophy quests.
