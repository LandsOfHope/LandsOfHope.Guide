The **Demonology** skill is a multi-purpose tool that serves three purposes.

*   Lets you learn and cast magic spells.
*   Lets you track demons.
*   Lets you tame demons.

Demonology is a class skill that the Warlock class receives.

_Players in other classes may also access the tracking and taming features of demonology through items but they will not be able to learn spells in this way._

**Magic Use  
**Demonology magic spells are drop only, and can not be acquired through a trainer they allow you to summon **candles** which are used in Demonology rituals.

To summon a warlock pet you will need two items, a candle and a variable quantity of flesh. When you have the required candle and flesh turn them in to the NPC at 51, 90 in Coldbreeze to get your new pet. The following pets are available:

*   Hellish Imp, Casts hell magic spells.
*   Souleater, steals mana from a target and gives it to you.
*   Lifetaker, steals health from a target and gives it to you.
*   Hellwarden, has no offensive powers but has high health and has a high amount of weapon defense skills.
*   Bloodmaiden, steals stamina from a target and gives it to you.
*   Whelp, a mixed combat pet with various melee skills and average stats.

The pets are quite varied and intended for different situations obviously the Souleater pet would not do so well versus a melee profession as it would have no mana.

**Tracking Use**  
Use World > Track > Demons and it will show the screen you use to track demons.

The track demons screen has two modes of operation, this allows you to use the screen to track the location of currently spawned monsters and players  or pets and to also track the location of usual spawn spots for monsters.

You can toggle between these two modes by using the option on the right of the screen.

*   Click the Track Active Spawns button to switch to tracking active players/pets and monsters.
*   Click the Track Map Spawns button to switch back to the default of tracking the locations of spawns.

In the top right corner are boxes where you can enter the level range of the target you wish to search for.

When tracking map spawns you should remember that each realm has a set level range so there is little point in using a level range outside of the normal for the realm.

*   1 - 100, Knotwood Valley
*   100 -200, Sandydale Basin
*   200 - 300, Riverscape
*   300 - 400, Barren Downs
*   400 - 500, Lakeview
*   500 - 600, Three Glaciaers
*   600 - 700, Coldbreeze
*   700 - 800,  Frostvale
*   800 - 900, Seven Sisters
*   900 - 1000, Royal Hollow

Also not all realms will have each classification of monster.

You can use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to move the displayed view around, if you find something on the map you will gain a **purple skill gain**. This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Tracking Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 demons you need 50 demonology skill_

You can not track outside of your skill range so if you wish to track higher level monsters than you currently have the skill for you will need to get items with bonuses on them for this tracking skill.

**Taming Use**  
If you find a demon monster while out on your travels, it will list the amount of Demonology skill that is required to tame the monster when you move the mouse over the monster.

There will also be a Tame or similar button (looks like a cage) in the middle bank of buttons, clicking on this button will attempt to tame the demon.

If successful the monster will become your pet and you will gain a **purple skill gain**.

**Taming Formula**  
Demonology required = ((Target Level \* 5) - 5)

_i.e. To tame a level 60 demon you need 295 demonology skill ((60 \* 5) - 5)_
