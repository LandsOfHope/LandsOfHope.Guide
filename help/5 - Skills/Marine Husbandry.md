The **Marine Husbandry** gathering skill alllows you to gather resources from the ocean. Marine Husbandry can be used to gather sea food such as Clams, Lobsters and Shrimp. It is also the only way to gather pearls for use in the bejeweling crafting skill.

**Skill Trainer Location  
**There is no skill trainer for this skill, it is gained for free by the Navy and League Privateer classes which are found in the Uncharted Waters expansion pack.

**Finding Marine resources  
**To gather marine resources you must first find a node. This can be done with use of the World > Resources screen, This screen will display a list of marine resources in the immediate area you have enough skill to gather. (only works in the Shrouded Isles realm)

If nothing shows up try using the arrow buttons to move the displayed area around.

Once you have found a resource on the resources screen click on it to travel to its location. The resource will show up in the bottom of the game window.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Resource Material Level \* 5)

_i.e. To gather a level 5 resource you need 25 skill (5 \* 5)._

There are no skill gains from using the World > Resources screen, the skill gains for this skill come from the act of harvesting which is explained later on.

**Gathering the resource  
**To gather the resource on a tile, click on the resource icon that is visible in the bottom of the game window. If you do not see a resource icon you are either in the wrong spot or the resource has not yet respawned.

As with all of the gathering skills you will need a tool, in this case a marine tool, if you do not have any suitable tool you will be shown a screen which lists all of the tools that can be used to fulfill the requirement.

Once you meet the requirements you can try again and it will take you straight to the actual gathering screen.

The gathering screen contains relevant information relating to the resource you are trying to gather. Such as:

*   Level of the resource
*   XP you will receive
*   Skill requirement
*   Your current skill
*   Queue time
*   How many resources are left at the location

There are two buttons below this information.

*   Marine husbandry, gather 1 resource and send it to the queue. You will stand a chance of a **green skill gain** per gather and the amount of resources on the tile will go down by 1.
*   All, gather all resources in one go and send them to the queue, you will stand a chance of a **green skill gain** but only one and not one for each resource that was present. Using all will also take 5 seconds longer.

Both buttons give experience and both buttons use the queue system. It is recommended you use the first button unless you are in a hurry and need resources over skill gains and experience.

Please note Marine Husbandry differs from other gathering skills in that it provides a random type of resource when you gather a marine trap. You will get Lobsters, Shrimp, Crabs, Oysters and if you are lucky you will also gain a pearl as a random bonus. These resources are used in the Uncharted Waters crafting skills Seamanship and Bejeweling.

Use the Inventory > Queue screen to receive your resource and experience when the time is up.

_Once all the resources have been used up it will take up to five minutes for them to respawn again._
