The **Disguise** skill is used to alter your physical appearance which makes it harder for you to be tracked. The higher your skill the more disguises you have available to use..

As well as changing your appearance some disguises also offer temporary enhancements and effects.

**Skill Use  
**The Character > Info screen has a button at the bottom called Disguise which takes you to the Disguise screen, this is where you perform the action of disguising or removing a disguise.

_It is also possible to create a Shortcut, via the Character > Shortcuts screen which allows you to access the Disguise screen simply by clicking a button on the game Shortcut bar._

When you access the Disguise screen you are given a list of all of the Disguises you have enough skill to use, the list is sorted by the amount of skill required so the higher skill use disguises are easier to find.

The Disguise screen has two buttons for performing the disguise action.

**Full**  
Disguises your character and changes your name and picture, this is particularly useful should you wish to disguise yourself to make your enemies have a harder time finding you.

It can also be useful to experiment and find races in the disguise list that change your race classification and make it so a different tracking skill is needed to find you.

**Partial**  
Disguises your character but preserves your picture and name, this is useful if you wish to change your race but don\`t want to lose your cool looking picture.

Using disguise grants a **guaranteed skill gain**, but it does not yield any experience.

**Removing a Disguise  
**If you wish to remove a disguise go to the Character > Info screen and you will find that instead of a disguise button you have a **remove** button. Click that to remove the disguise.

_Being bitten by a Nightstalker or Feralkin as well as some of the appearance changing item effects are classed as disguisesÂ  and can be removed using this button also._
