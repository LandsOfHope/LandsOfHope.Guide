The **Targeted Combat** skill is a class skill that Denshis gain. This skill allows you to target specific body parts rather than attacking the target in general.

While you will not hit the body part each turn there is a 12 - 15% chance of you hitting, and the effect that is dealt to the target depends on the location you are hitting. 

**Targeted Combat Use**  
To use this skill you simply click the "Targeted Combat" button on the fight screen, then choose the body part you wish to target.

After selecting a target you will gain 1 skill point in targeted combat, and as your skill rises you will see more body parts to attack.
