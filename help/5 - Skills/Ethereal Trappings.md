The **Ethereal Trappings** skill is a multi-purpose tool that serves two purposes.

*   Lets you track magical monsters.
*   Lets you tame magical monsters.

Ethereal Trappings is only available as a bought extra item via the File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items screen select the Ethereal Bindings item.

_After purchasing the bought extra and taking it out of your Inventory > Containers > Trade Bag you will need to equip it then go to Inventory > Spells to activate the Ethereal Knowledge spell that gives you access to this skill._

**Tracking Use**  
Use World > Track > Magicals and it will show the screen you use to track magical beings.

The track magicals screen has two modes of operation, this allows you to use the screen to track the location of currently spawned monsters and players  or pets and to also track the location of usual spawn spots for monsters.

You can toggle between these two modes by using the option on the right of the screen.

*   Click the Track Active Spawns button to switch to tracking active players/pets and monsters.
*   Click the Track Map Spawns button to switch back to the default of tracking the locations of spawns.

In the top right corner are boxes where you can enter the level range of the target you wish to search for.

When tracking map spawns you should remember that each realm has a set level range so there is little point in using a level range outside of the normal for the realm.

*   1 - 100, Knotwood Valley
*   100 -200, Sandydale Basin
*   200 - 300, Riverscape
*   300 - 400, Barren Downs
*   400 - 500, Lakeview
*   500 - 600, Three Glaciaers
*   600 - 700, Coldbreeze
*   700 - 800,  Frostvale
*   800 - 900, Seven Sisters
*   900 - 1000, Royal Hollow

Also not all realms will have each classification of monster.

This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Tracking Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 magical beings you need 50 ethereal trappings skill_

You can not track outside of your skill range so if you wish to track higher level monsters than you currently have the skill for you will need to get items with bonuses on them for this tracking skill.

**Taming Use**  
If you find a magical monster while out on your travels, it will list the amount of Ethereal Trapping skill that is required to tame the monster when you move the mouse over the monster.

There will also be a Tame or similar button (looks like a cage) in the middle bank of buttons, clicking on this button will attempt to tame the magical being.

If successful the monster will become your pet.

**Taming Formula**  
Ethereal Trappings required = ((Target Level \* 5) - 5)

_i.e. To tame a level 60 magical being you need 295 ethereal trappings skill ((60 \* 5) - 5)_
