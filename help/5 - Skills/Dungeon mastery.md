The **Dungeon Mastery** skill is a special skill that players can acquire at level 395 in the fourth realm called Lakeview. The skill allows you to make your very own Dungeons and gives you the opportunity to make experience when people fight and win or die in your dungeon potentially allowing you to gain experience 24/7 if your dungeons prove popular.

NOTE To prevent abuse a Dungeon master (or any player on that account) can not gain experience or rewards from fighting in a dungeon they made. The intended use of this skill is for players to make dungeons for others not for self use ... if it did allow you to use your own it would be abusive.

**Skill Use  
**Dungeon mastery skill is primarily a crafting skill, you use the crafting menu at Inventory > Tradeskills > Dungeon Mastery to craft deeds for rooms and the dungeons themselves.

Dungeon mastery is also much more than merely a crafting skill as it encompasses many screens and feature subsets that allow you to craft the best dungeon in Myzan.

After learning the Dungeon mastery skill you will need to buy plans from a plan trainer, these then become available on your crafting screen.

_For a full list of all of the Dungeon mastery plans, please visit the Library > Buidlings screen inside the game and click the Dungeon button located at the bottom._

**How to craft a Dungeon Deed**  
After purchasing the Small Dungeon plan (or any dungeon plan) use the Inventory > Tradeskill > Dungeon Mastery screen to select the plan and assemble it.

As with any crafting skill you will need to provide the required ingredients, in this case bricks (Stonemasonry) and planks (Carpentry) these can in theory be any level you want, however as this is a crafting skill you will need to provide the relevant level of material to stand a chance of a skill gain.

**Recommended Material Formula**  
Primary Ingredient Level = (Dungeon Mastery / 5) + 5

i.e. If you have 50 Dungeon Mastery you have a chance of getting a skill gain by using level 15 material.

As long as your primary ingredient level is +- 25 skill points from your actual Dungeon Mastery skill you will stand a chance of a **green skill** gain.

**How to craft a Room Deed**  
Repeat the same process as crafting a dungeon deed but choose a room plan instead of a dungeon plan.

_Once you have used the ingredients your crafted deed will be sent to your Queue screen after the time required has expired you can access the Inventory > Queue screen to have your deeds completed and moved to your Inventory screen. You will gain experience from crafting the deeds once the Queue timer runs out._
