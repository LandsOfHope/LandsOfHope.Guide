The **Patchcrafting** skill is a crafting skill that can be learnt only by those people that have purchased the Jurassic Wars expansion pack. Seek out the trainer in Juratania at 43, 71.

This skill allows you to craft special patches that can be fitted to existing items and weapons to increase the effects and bonuses the items provide.

_Unlike the other crafting skills you need to complete trophy quests from the Patchcrafter NPCs inside Camp Eversight. Each trophy quest you complete will unlock one of the patches you can make._

**Crafting**  
After you have learnt the skill and at least one plan you can access the crafting screen by going to Inventory > Tradeskills > Patchcrafting.

The crafting screen will list all of the plans you currently have enough skill to use.

_If you learn a plan while you have bonus items to patchcrafting equipped then take the item off and your skill drops below the required skill level for that plan you will not be able to use it until it goes back up to the required skill level._

For more information on the other buttons on the crafting screen please check out the help topic linked below which will explain them in great detail.

To begin constructing a patch simply click on the plan on the left of the screen this will cause the bottom of the screen to update and display the ingredient selection box.

The ingredient box as the name suggests lists all of the ingredients that are required to make the item. By default the screen will automatically pick the best ingredients you have for the task at hand but there may be times when you wish to change the ingredients to use a lower level one if you are making items for someone else or to sell, in such cases clicking on the ingredient on the left of the screen will cause the middle of the box to display a list of compatible ingredients you currently have and let you pick one to replace the default it selected.

When you are happy with the list of ingredients you are using simply click the Assemble button on the right side of the screen and the item will be added to your Inventory > Queue screen.

Crafting items stands a chance of a **green skill gain** when using the right level primary ingredient (formula below) and also experience when you finish the item in the queue screen.

If any ingredients on the list show up red it means you are missing those ingredients or you do not have high enough skill to use the ones you have in your inventory.

**Material Formula**  
Material Level = ((Patchcrafting / 5) + 5)

_i.e. If you have 100 patchcrafting you can work with up to level 25 materials ((100 / 5) + 5)._

This allows you to work around material gaps (times when there is not a material every 5 levels).

**Fitting Patches**  
Go to your Inventory screen and click on the patch you wish to install then click the use button.

The install screen will then be shown which will list all of the items the selected patch can modify in your inventory. It also indicates what stat will be effected and how much of a bonus will be applied.

You can only have one patch per item at any one time although you can remove a patch as required.

Click the Install button to use the patch up and fit it into the item.
