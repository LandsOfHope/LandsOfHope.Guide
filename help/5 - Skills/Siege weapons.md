The **Siege weapons** skill is a generic weapon skill available to all through a quest from the Fenwood Siegery inside Fenwood Town in the Sandydale Basin map.

_Everyone can learn this skill by completing a simple quest._

As with ordinary combat weapon skills to be able to use weapons that are linked to this skill you must physically know the skill , after learning the skill you will be able to equip and use weapons like catapults and battering rams.

As well as allowing you to equip and use siege weapons this skill also determines what styles you can learn and therefore use in siege combat.

Siege weapons are equipped to a special siege slot and generally require special ammunition.

_For a full list of the styles available for any weapon skill you can use the Library > Styles screen._

_For a full list of the weapons that are tied to a specific skill you can use the Library > Items > Weapons screen._

_To learn new styles visit the appropriate style trainer you can view the locations of style trainers via the Help > Manual > Realm Name guide page._

**Siege Style Use**  
To use a siege weapon style in sieging you need three things:

*   Stamina, each style requires a fixed amount of stamina.
*   Skill, each style requires a fixed amount of weapon skill (the same amount that was needed to learn the style from the trainer).
*   Weapon, a style can only be used if the correct type of weapon is equipped.

To attack with a manually chosen siege style click the attack building button then choose which style you wish to use.

You can also ready some styles using the Abilities > Styles screen then use the readied buttons instead of the manual buttons. The game will then pick the best style you have the stats to use that is on your ready list.

As the fight goes on your stamina will go down so the list of available styles will go down.
