The **Healing magic** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the Healing line of magic.

The following playable classes get the healing magic skill:

*   Abbot
*   Arch Priest
*   Healer
*   Monk
*   Protector

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into both categories as it contains a varied range of spells including:

*   Heal spells
*   Buff spells
*   Drain spells

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Healing magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._  

**Casting a drain spell**  
You can cast such spells in combat in two different ways.

*   Click the cast defensive spell button
*   Click the cast readied defensive spell button

To cast a readied spell you must have first readied the spell, to do this go to the Abilities > Ready Spells screen and choose the spells you wish to ready.

To cast any spell in combat you need two main things:

*   Intelligence, this determines which spells you can cast regardless of how much mana you have.
*   Mana, mana is consumed when you cast spells you can only cast a spell if you have enough mana to do so.

After casting a spell you will gain a **purple skill gain**.

*   Click the cast heal/cure spell button
*   Click the cast readied cast heal spell button
