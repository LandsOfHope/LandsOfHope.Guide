This skill allows you to craft many different types of items for furnishing (placing) into buildings or selling to others to place into buildings. You can craft all kinds of things from beds to boxes.

As with all of the crafting skills you will need to learn plans for the furnishing skill, seek out a plan trainer for this skill or buy dropped plans from other players.

_You can visit the realm guide pages at Help > Manual > Realm Name to locate both the skill trainer and plan trainers._

You also need furnishing skill to place the items you make inside a room.

**Crafting**  
After you have learnt the skill and at least one plan you can access the crafting screen by going to Inventory > Tradeskills > Furnishing.

The crafting screen will list all of the plans you currently have enough skill to use.

_If you learn a plan while you have bonus items to furnishing equipped then take the item off and your skill drops below the required skill level for that plan you will not be able to use it until it goes back up to the required skill level._

For more information on the other buttons on the crafting screen please check out the help topic linked below which will explain them in great detail.

To begin constructing a furnishing item simply click on the plan on the left of the screen this will cause the bottom of the screen to update and display the ingredient selection box.

The ingredient box as the name suggests lists all of the ingredients that are required to make the item. By default the screen will automatically pick the best ingredients you have for the task at hand but there may be times when you wish to change the ingredients to use a lower level one if you are making items for someone else or to sell, in such cases clicking on the ingredient on the left of the screen will cause the middle of the box to display a list of compatible ingredients you currently have and let you pick one to replace the default it selected.

When you are happy with the list of ingredients you are using simply click the Assemble button on the right side of the screen and the item will be added to your Inventory > Queue screen.

Crafting items stands a chance of a **green skill gain** when using the right level primary ingredient (formula below) and also experience when you finish the item in the queue screen.

If any ingredients on the list show up red it means you are missing those ingredients or you do not have high enough skill to use the ones you have in your inventory.

**Material Formula**  
Material Level = ((Furnishing / 5) + 5)

_i.e. If you have 100 furnishing you can work with up to level 25 materials ((100 / 5) + 5)._

This allows you to work around material gaps (times when there is not a material every 5 levels).

**Placing Furnishings**  
To place a furnishing item inside a room the room must support that item. Not every room can support every item for example you can not put a bed into a kitchen.

To furnish a building go stand inside it and click the renovate button at the bottom of the screen. It will then show a map of the building and you can click on the individual rooms to show the renovation screen.

As well as requiring the item be compatible with the room you also need to have the right amount of skill to place the item.

**Placing Formula**  
Skill required = (Item Level \* 5)

_i.e. To place a level 50 furnishing you need 250 skill (50 \* 5)._

Placing an item will give you a chance for a **green skill gain** if the item is the right level for your skill.
