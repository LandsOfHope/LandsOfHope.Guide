The **Poisoning** skill is used to craft poison solutions, these are potions that can be applied to a weapon by anyone regardless of if they know the poisoning skill or not.

_Poisoning is a Killer class skill and can not be learnt by anyone but the Killer class._

**Skill Use  
**After you have purchased poisoning spells (from the poisoning trainers) you are free to make an unlimited amount of poisons from each spell.

Go to the Inventory > Tradeskill > Poisoning screen and it will list all of the poisoning spells you currently know and have enough skill to make solutions from.

Information on each poison is provided for you such as the percentage chance the poison will trigger. Click the Make button to have your solution added to your queue. As with all the skills that use the queue you will not gain any experience or the items you are making until you visit the Inventory > Queue screen after the queue timer has run out.

You will gain a **guaranteed skill gain** for each solution you queue.

Poisons generally do less damage per round than a similar level inscription but they have the ability to last several rounds which means if they hit you can do a nice bonus amount of damage far more than an inscription would do normally.
