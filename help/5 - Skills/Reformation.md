The **Reformation** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the reformation line of magic.

The following playable classes get the reformation skill:

*   Animator (and all evolutions there after)

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into the out of combat castable category as it contains buff spells only.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Reformation magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs on your golems outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose the reformation skill line. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Golem, lets you choose which of your golems to cast the spell on.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
