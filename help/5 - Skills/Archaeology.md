The **Archaeology** skill is a class skilled obtained only by the Archaeologist class (Salvager evolution). It can be used in conjunction with the Salvaging ability to gather and then use ancient dungeon keys from.

The dungeons the keys create may contain ancient relics that only archaeologists can find and use.

**Skill Use  
**When you use the Salvage button on the loot screen you stand a random chance of gaining an ancient dungeon key, these are similar to the lesser and jagged or bloody dungeon keys you may have encountered at lower levels except these keys can only be fully used by an Archaeologist.

Find yourself an empty tile and use the dungeon key from your inventory it will then create a Mysterious dungeon for you to fight in. As with other temporary dungeons you have two days of use out of the dungeon and it will remain until it is destroyed by you or the game deletes it.

The dungeon will be bigger than other key dungeons and more spaced out, it will have a similar make up of rooms as the lesser dungeons except the treasure rooms will have been replaced with Relic Rooms.

_These dungeons are randomly generated when you use the key, so the actual makeup of the dungeon and how many rooms and what types of rooms it has are often varied and you may not get a relic room or a boss room each time._

If you are lucky enough to find a Relic Room inside your dungeon there is an Ancient Relic Chest inside which you can click on to open and retrieve an item from inside at which point you have a random chance of a skill gain.

There is a chance that you will receive a Mysterious Relic from out of the chest, this is an item that Archaeologists need to uncover to actually gain a true reward.

Go to your Inventory screen, click on the Mysterious Relic and click the use button. The Archaeologist Uncover screen will be shown and this is where you perform the uncovering. Uncovering a Relic will give you a **guaranteed skill gain** and one of about 20 different rewards, some of the rewards like the figurines can be equipped (only by Archaeologists) while other items are just for show and/or placement into a Museum building.
