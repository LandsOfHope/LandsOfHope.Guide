The **Deconstruction** skill is both a class skill and a skill that anyone can buy training in. The Salvager bought extra profession gets this skill to start with, but anyone can purchase this skill from the deconstruction skill trainer.

The skill is used to dismantle items, in total several thousand items can be dismantled. You can dismantle almost any craftable item (that is an item that can be made via the Inventory > Tradeskill crafting skills). You may also find you can dismantle other items that were not crafted but dropped from monsters such as weapons and clothing, this is typically because that item is craftable.

**Skill Use**  
The skill can be used either by clicking the Dismantle button at the bottom of the Inventory > Containers screen or by using the Inventory > Actions > Dismantle menu link. Both of these methods show exactly the same screen.

The Dismantle screen shows a list of all of the items in your inventory that can be dismantled, if an item does not show up on the list then the chances are it can not be dismantled or you simply do not have enough skill to dismantle that item yet.

There are two important buttons on the dismantle screen they are the Slow and Fast dismantle buttons.

*   Slow dismantle, dismantles the item using the Queue system You will receive experience and your goods when the queue timer is up.
*   Fast dismantle, dismantles the item immediately but you do not gain experience.

Both methods stand a chance of a **green skill gain** when using the correct level materials.

You will receive a random resource from dismantling based on the level of the item and what ingredients that item usually takes. In such cases as an item takes multiple quantities of ingredients to make you will receive a random amount of ingredient back but no more than is required for the recipe.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Item Level \* 5)

_i.e. To dismantle a level 50 item you will need 250 deconstruction skill (50 \* 5)._
