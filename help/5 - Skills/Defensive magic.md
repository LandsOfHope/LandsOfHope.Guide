The **Defensive magic** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the Defensive line of magic.

The following playable classes get the defensive magic skill:

*   Mage

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into the out of combat castable category as it contains buffs for use outside of combat.:

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Defensive magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._  

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose which spell line you wish to cast spells from. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Cast on me, lets you cast the spell on yourself.
*   Other, lets you choose who to cast the spell on if the spell can be cast on more than just you.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
