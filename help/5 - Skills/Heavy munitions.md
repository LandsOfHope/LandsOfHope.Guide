The **Heavy Munitions** skill is a weapon skill. It is a skill that the following playable classes get:

*   Bombadier

As with all weapon skills to be able to use weapons that are linked to this skill you must physically know the skill only the classes that get the skill naturally can therefore use heavy munitions as you can not train in this skill.

As well as allowing you to equip and use heavy munitions weapons this skill also determines what styles you can learn and therefore use in combat.

This skill is a ranged skill which means you can equip a heavy munitions weapon to your ranged slot and still have other weapons equipped in your hands. As a ranged skill you should also equip ammo to maximise your damage potential in the case of thrown magic the ammo is ordnance.

Please note that having high Dex will increase the damage this type of ranged weapon does with the ratio of 10pts of Dex = 1pt of damage.

_For a full list of the styles available for any weapon skill you can use the Library > Styles screen._

_For a full list of the weapons that are tied to a specific skill you can use the Library > Items > Weapons screen._

_To learn new styles visit the appropriate style trainer you can view the locations of style trainers via the Help > Manual > Realm Name guide page._

**Combat Style Use**  
To use a combat style in combat you need three things:

*   Stamina, each style requires a fixed amount of stamina.
*   Skill, each style requires a fixed amount of weapon skill (the same amount that was needed to learn the style from the trainer).
*   Weapon, a style can only be used if the correct type of weapon is equipped.

To attack with a manually chosen combat style click the attack enemy button then choose which style you wish to use.

To attack with a manually chosen ranged combat style click the attack with ranged button then choose which style you wish to use.

You can also ready some styles using the Abilities > Styles screen then use the readied buttons instead of the manual buttons. The game will then pick the best style you have the stats to use that is on your ready list.

As the fight goes on your stamina will go down so the list of available styles will go down.
