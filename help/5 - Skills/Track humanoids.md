The track humanoids screen has two modes of operation, this allows you to use the screen to track the location of currently spawned monsters and players  or pets and to also track the location of usual spawn spots for monsters.

You can toggle between these two modes by using the option on the right of the screen.

*   Click the Track Active Spawns button to switch to tracking active players/pets and monsters.
*   Click the Track Map Spawns button to switch back to the default of tracking the locations of spawns.

In the top right corner are boxes where you can enter the level range of the target you wish to search for.

When tracking map spawns you should remember that each realm has a set level range so there is little point in using a level range outside of the normal for the realm.

*   1 - 100, Knotwood Valley
*   100 -200, Sandydale Basin
*   200 - 300, Riverscape
*   300 - 400, Barren Downs
*   400 - 500, Lakeview
*   500 - 600, Three Glaciaers
*   600 - 700, Coldbreeze
*   700 - 800,  Frostvale
*   800 - 900, Seven Sisters
*   900 - 1000, Royal Hollow

Also not all realms will have each classification of monster.

You can use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to move the displayed view around, if you find something on the map you will gain a **purple skill gain**. This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 humanoids you need 50 track humanoids skill_

You can not track outside of your skill range so if you wish to track higher level monsters than you currently have the skill for you will need to get items with bonuses on them for this tracking skill.
