The **Frenzy** skill represents your ability to deal aditional damage while in the heat of battle. Frenzy is a class skill available to the Berserker class. It is a passive skill so requires no extra screens or fancy buttons, every time you take physical damage (not magical damage) you gain more rage.

**Skill Use  
**Your frenzy skill determines how much rage you can get, for each point in frenzy you can gain 1pt of rage. Rage is then added back onto your physical damage and used up.  
  
_Note: Some defensive/healing actions such as being healed or resting will lower your Rage points._  
  
The higher the skill the more damage you can potentially deal.

Your rage is cumulative you can gain a lot of rage if you are frequently hit which you can unleash over time as added damage. To this end a true beserker may find that getting rid of items that help them evade physical attacks such as Dexterity and concentrating all out on strength and stamina and attack power may make them a formidable foe.
