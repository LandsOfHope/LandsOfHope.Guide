The **Druid Magic** skill is a multi-purpose tool that serves three purposes.

*   Lets you breed insects with other insects and plants with other plants.
*   Lets you track insects and plants.
*   Lets you tame insects and plants.

Druid magic is a class skill that the Druid class receives.

Players in other classes may also access the tracking the features of druid magic although items with druid magic on them are somewhat rare.

**Breeding Use  
**Through breeding you can breed one race of insect with another or one race of plant with another. The offspring of the breeding process is a pet that has the race of one of the parents and the profession of the other.

This makes for some interesting pet combinations, you can also set the level of the pet you wish to make.

Use the Minions > Breeding (Insect/Plant breeding) screens to breed.

To breed you will need a male and female pet (monsters must be tamed before they can be bred).

Check the Minions > Breeding > Breeding Queue screen to hatch/finish your pet and earn any experience you are due, breeding will earn a **purple skill gain**.

**Breeding Formula  
**Skill required = (Max Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To breed a level 50 and level 100 insect pet you will need 500 skill (100 \* 5)._

**Tracking Use**  
Use World > Track > Plants or Insects and it will show the screen you use to track.

_Use the buttons in the bar in the middle of the screen to switch between tracking plants and tracking insects after you load the screen or you can use the menu,_

The tracking screen has two modes of operation, this allows you to use the screen to track the location of currently spawned monsters and players  or pets and to also track the location of usual spawn spots for monsters.

You can toggle between these two modes by using the option on the right of the screen.

*   Click the Track Active Spawns button to switch to tracking active players/pets and monsters.
*   Click the Track Map Spawns button to switch back to the default of tracking the locations of spawns.

In the top right corner are boxes where you can enter the level range of the target you wish to search for.

When tracking map spawns you should remember that each realm has a set level range so there is little point in using a level range outside of the normal for the realm.

**The highest frequency of insects and plants can be found in the Jurassic Wars realm of Juratania.**

You can use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to move the displayed view around, if you find something on the map you will gain a **purple skill gain**. This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Tracking Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 insects you need 50 druid magic skill_

You can not track outside of your skill range so if you wish to track higher level monsters than you currently have the skill for you will need to get items with bonuses on them for this tracking skill.

**Taming Use**  
If you find a insect or plant monster while out on your travels, it will list the amount of Druid magic skill that is required to tame the monster when you move the mouse over the monster.

There will also be a Tame or similar button (looks like a cage) in the middle bank of buttons, clicking on this button will attempt to tame the monster.

If successful the monster will become your pet and you will gain a **purple skill gain**.

**Taming Formula**  
Demonology required = ((Target Level \* 5) - 5)

_i.e. To tame a level 60 demon you need 295 demonology skill ((60 \* 5) - 5)_
