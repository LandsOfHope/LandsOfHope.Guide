The **Detect Hidden** skill is used to reveal Players and Buildings that have been hidden from normal sight using either magic or the Stealth Skill. It is particularly useful for tracking down players with bounties.

Detect Hidden is a class skill that Scouts, Hunters, Sharpshooters, Shadowstalkers, Killers and Assassins get access to. It may also be used through items and other bonus effects.

**Skill Use  
**As this skill can be used to perform two different actions there are two different screens, these are explained below.

**Revealing Stealthed Players**  
Detect hidden skill can be used to reveal players that have stealthed themselves, there are many reasons why a player may stealth. They may wish to remain anonymous and out of sight or they may have a bounty and wish to make it harder for someone to claim the bounty.

To use the skill to reveal a player go to World > Reveal > Players.

_You can not reveal another player if you yourself are stealthed so you will need to use the Character > Info screen to remove your stealth if you are stealthed._

The reveal screen for players will list all of the players at the current location you have enough skill to reveal.

_Note: If you are in an allegiance you can only reveal players who are neutral or in an opposing allegiance._

The screen also lists a few other details such as the amount of stealth skill required to reveal them, how much bounty a player has and what level they are.

Successfully revealing someone will give a **purple skill gain** as well as some experience. A message will also be sent to the target to let them know they are no longer hidden.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = Stealth Skill Used

_i.e. If someone stealthed with 50 stealth skill then you will need 50 detect hidden skill or more to reveal them._

**Revealing Stealthed Rooms  
**Detect hidden skill can be used to reveal rooms inside buildings that are stealthed. Typically there are not too many stealthed rooms in the game, however it is possible for Dungeon Masters to add stealthed rooms to their dungeons which will require you to reveal the rooms to progress past them.

There are a number of buildings in each realm called "Criminal Dens" these are buildings that have a number of uses and are intended for rogues to use but they also have a number of stealthed rooms that allow players with detect hidden to work on their skill.

To use the skill to reveal a room go to World > Reveal > Buildings.

The reveal screen for rooms is displayed as a room map, rooms that need to be revealed are semi-transparent while rooms that are already revealed or can not be revealed are solid. The amount of skill required to reveal a room depends on what the dungeon owner set it to.

To reveal a room click on the room that you wish to reveal, then click the button on the right of the screen. If successful the room will be revealed and you will get a **purple skill gain** but no experience. The revealed room will show up for 30minutes before reverting back to being stealthed.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = Stealth Skill Used

_i.e. If someone stealthed a room with 50 stealth skill then you will need 50 detect hidden skill or more to reveal it._
