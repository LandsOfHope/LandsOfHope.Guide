The **Bewitching** skill is used to craft spellbound items, these are magical effects that can be sold and traded with other players and applied to leg, chest, feet, hand and head items (Bewitching skill required to craft the spellbound item but not to fit it into an item).

This is a class skill gained by the Witch (level 650)  evolution of the Hag class.

**Skill Use**  
After you have unlocked the Bewitching skill you are free to make an unlimited amount of spellbound items.

Go to the Inventory > Tradeskill > Bewitching screen and it will list all of the bewitching plans you currently know and have enough skill to make spellbindings from.

Click the Make button to have your spellbinding added to your queue. As with all the skills that use the queue you will not gain any experience or the items you are making until you visit the Inventory > Queue screen after the queue timer has run out.

You will gain a guaranteed skill gain for each spellbinding you queue.

Spellbindings generally require special ingredients that come from the Afterlife Expansion only.
