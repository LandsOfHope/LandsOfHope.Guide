The **Track and Capture criminals** skill is a class skill that Hunters gain (Archer evolution), the skill provides two possible uses:

*   Track criminal players and pets
*   Arrest criminals and monsters

**Tracking Skill Use  
**Use World > Track > Criminals and it will show the screen you use to track criminals (players/pets with bounties).

In the top right corner are boxes where you can enter the level range of the target you wish to search for.

A limited amount of results is displayed at any one time so you may find you have to adjust the level range to a smaller range if there are a lot of matches.

Results with three ? symbols indicate that person is inside a building at that location, you will have to enter the buildings to find them.

You can use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to move the displayed view around, if you find something on the map you will gain a **purple skill gain**. This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 criminals you need 50 track and capture criminals skill_

**Capturing Criminals and Monsters**  
After finding a criminal using the track screen or from a chance encounter on a tile you can capture the criminal by moving the mouse over them and clicking the Capture button in the middle of the screen. You will gain a **purple skill gain** and the bounty that was on the target when you captured them.

You can capture any monster in the same way, while monsters are not necessarily criminals for the purpose of training they all have bounties that can be claimed.

_A captured player/pet is sent to jail for a length of time based on the amount of bounty that was on their head, while a captured monster is deleted from the game (see Jail time formula at bottom)._

**Formula**  
Skill Required = ((Target Level \* 5) - 5)

_i.e. To arrest a level 10 criminals you need 45 track and capture criminals skill_

As you probably noticed we use a different formula for capturing than we do for tracking. This is to allow trackers a bit of an advantage when capturing.

**Jail Time Formula**  
Time in Minutes = (Bounty / 1000) + 1

_Jail times over 60minutes are not possible so if the above calculation comes out over 60 it is set to 60._
