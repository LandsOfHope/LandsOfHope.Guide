The **Husbandry** skill is used to care for monsters and pets classed as beasts, it lets you gather resources such as milk and meat and other resources used in cooking. This skill can be learnt by anyone regardless of class.

**Skill Trainer Location  
**Kaelia Kaka at 31, 59 in Knotwood Valley  
  
This skill works only on beasts and can not be used on Humanoids or other types of monsters (see Surgery for a similar feature on Humanoids).  
  
You may care for your own pets but be careful as some actions that Husbandry allows you to do will kill your poor pet.

**Skill Use**  
Husbandry is performed through the Care feature, when you move the mouse over a Pet or Monster you will notice there are two care buttons in the middle of the screen. The first care button can be used by a player to care for animals while the second care button can be used to have a pet that knows the husbandry skill care for the animal.

The Care screen shows a list of actions that can be performed, the list alters depending on race.

Typically a common list of caring options are Milk, Butcher and Skin but there are some other ones and special ones.

*   Dinosaur, butcher meat.
*   Most Beasts, Milk (female), Shear, Butcher, Heart, Eyes, Brain
*   Most Undead, Flesh and Bone and Skull
*   Birds, Eggs and Feathers
*   Fish, Butcher for Fillets
*   Wood, fiber
*   Spider, thread
*   Snake, skin and scales

_Note: The actions in red on the care screen typically involve killing your target, so do not use them if you are caring for a prized pet or it will be deleted from the game._

Caring for a target within 25 - 50 skill points of your Husbandry skill will yield a **green skill gain** chance. It will also use the Inventory > Queue system and provide experience upon completion of the queue.

**Formula**  
Skill required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To care for a level 100 Cow you will need 500 or more Husbandry skill._
