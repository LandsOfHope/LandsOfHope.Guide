The **Blood over Beauty** skill is a crafting skill that can be used by the Stitchwork class (Automotron bought extra).

This skill allows you to craft both special armor like items and augments that can be fitted into such items, this line focuses on body part improvement rather than technological improvement.

_Plans can be acquired from a plan trainer that has not as yet been added._

**Crafting**  
After you have learnt the skill and at least one plan you can access the crafting screen by going to Inventory > Tradeskills > Blood over Beauty.

The crafting screen will list all of the plans you currently have enough skill to use.

_If you learn a plan while you have bonus items to blood over beauty equipped then take the item off and your skill drops below the required skill level for that plan you will not be able to use it until it goes back up to the required skill level._

For more information on the otherÂ buttons on the crafting screen please check out the help topic linked below which will explain them in great detail.

To begin constructing an item simply click on the plan on the left of the screen this will cause the bottom of the screen to update and display the ingredient selection box.

The ingredient box as the name suggests lists all of the ingredients that are required to make the item. By default the screen will automatically pick the best ingredients you have for the task at hand but there may be times when you wish to change the ingredients to use a lower level one if you are making items for someone else or to sell, in such cases clicking on the ingredient on the left of the screen will cause the middle of the box to display a list of compatible ingredients you currently have and let you pick one to replace the default it selected.

When you are happy with the list of ingredients you are using simply click the Assemble button on the right side of the screen and the item will be added to your Inventory > Queue screen.

Crafting items stands a chance of a **green skill gain** when using the right level primary ingredient (formula below) and also experience when you finish the item in the queue screen.

If any ingredients on the list show up red it means you are missing those ingredients or you do not have high enough skill to use the ones you have in your inventory.

**Material Formula**  
Material Level = ((Blood over beauty/ 5) + 5)

_i.e. If you have 100 blood over beauty skill you can work with up to level 25 materials ((100 / 5) + 5)._

This allows you to work around material gaps (times when there is not a material every 5 levels).
