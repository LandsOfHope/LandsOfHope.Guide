The **Mana Regeneration** skill is used to determine how quickly you regenerate lost mana during combat.

Regeneration occurs once per round.

_This skill is only available as a bonus on items or spells it is not a class skill and it can never be trained or raised as it would be too powerful._  
  
**Formula**  
Mana regained =Â (MANA REGENERATION)  
  
This means that for every 1pt you have in this skill you gain 1mana per round.
