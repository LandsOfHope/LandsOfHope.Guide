The **Begging** skill is used to beg from players and monsters, it is a class skill that the Hermit class starts with it may also be acquired and used from item bonuses.  
  
Monsters start with a small purse of money which can be begged from, Players have a small purse which goes up the more money they earn.  
  
_When you beg from a player you take money from this purse until it is empty, the Player purse is seperate from the held funds of that player so by begging from someone you will never actually make them poor._

**Skill Use  
**To use this skill click the Beg button which is located at the bottom of the main world screen.

The beg screen shows a list of all of the targets at the same location as you that can be begged from. The screen shows all targets regardless of if you have enough skill to beg from them or not although obviously you can only beg from a target if it is within your skill range.

_When you beg from a target you gain part of the targets hidden purse, this is something that the player can not directly add or take from so in that way you are not doing anything bad to the player._

Begging will provide a **guaranteed skill gain** each time as well as experience and an amount of the targets hidden purse.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = ((Target LevelÂ \* 5) - 10)

_i.e. To beg from a level 10 monster you need 40 begging skill._
