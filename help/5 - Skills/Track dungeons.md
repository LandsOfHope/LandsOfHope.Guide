The track dungeons screen shows a view of the immediate area with the ability to change the level range you are looking for by using the boxes on the right of the screen.

To move the displayed view around use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen.

If you have enough skill to find a dungeon you will gain a **purple skill gain**. As with the other tracking skills this skill does not give you any experience.

_Click on the displayed dungeon either on the map or the list on the right to travel to that location._

**Formula**  
Skill required = (Dungeon Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track a level 5 dungeon you need 25 skill (5 \* 5)._
