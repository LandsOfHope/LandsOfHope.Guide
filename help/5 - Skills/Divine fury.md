The **Divine fury** skill represents your ability to deal aditional damage while doing the work of your god. Divine fury is a class skill available to the Crusader class. It is a passive skill so requires no extra screens or fancy buttons, every time you take magical damage you gain more fury.

The divine fury skill also has a few simple magic spells and determines what spells you can learn from the divine fury line of magic.

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into the out of combat castable category as it contains buff spells only.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Divine fury magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._

**Skill Use  
**Your divine fury skill determines how much fury you can get, for each point in divine fury you can gain 1pt of fury. Fury is then added back onto your physical damage and used up.  
  
_Note: Some defensive/healing actions such as being healed or resting will lower your Fury points._  
  
The higher the skill the more damage you can potentially deal.

Your fury is cumulative you can gain a lot of fury if you are frequently cast upon which you can unleash over time as added damage. To this end a true crusader may find that getting rid of items that help them evade physical attacks such as Dexterity and concentrating all out on strength and stamina and attack power may make them a formidable foe.  
  
**Formula**  
Damage Dealt + RANDOM(FURY POINTS)

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose which spell line you wish to cast spells from. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Cast on me, lets you cast the spell on yourself.
*   Other, lets you choose who to cast the spell on if the spell can be cast on more than just you.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
