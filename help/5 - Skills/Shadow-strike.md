The **Shadow-strike** skill is a special class skill that Assassins get. The skill allows an assassin the ability to use special shadow-strike combat styles, which are available while stealthed.

_A shadow-strike style is used in the first round of the fight and no other, but deals more damage than ordinary styles.._

_This skill **can not** be acquired through item bonuses as you can not learn combat styles like that._

You can buy shadow-strike styles from style trainers, use the Help > Manual > Realm Name pages to look up suitable trainers.

**Skill Use**  
The Shadow-strike skill is used in combat, it functions similarly to other combat style skills.

You must be stealthed for Shadow-strike to work, if you are not stealthed no styles will show up.

Choosing the attack button will present a list of styles you can use, if this is currently the first round of the fight the list should contain shadow-strike styles amongst others.

Shadow-strike is not weapon dependant you can use it with any weapon equipped, however a shadow-strike style can only be used in the first round of a fight and not subsequent rounds.

Simply click on a shadow-strike style to use it in combat. The beauty of shadow-strike over other weapon styles is that the shadow-strike styles require less stamina and deal more damage, which makes them an excellent ability for assassins to use.

**Style use formula**  
There are several formula which determine the styles you can use in combat.

To use a style you must have met the following rules:

*   Have enough totalÂ stamina
*   Have enough current stamina
*   Have enough Shadow-strike skill

If you do not meet all three of these then you can not use that style so it will not show up or be available in combat, but a lesser one may be.
