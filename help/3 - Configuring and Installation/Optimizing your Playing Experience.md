Greetings, my wonderful players.

Sometimes I have seen a few people complain of lag in the game, at times when no one else is having a problem.

There are a number of reasons for this, some are beyond my and your control (ISP or Internet problems).

However there are a few reasons why the game might run slow for you, in particular the following reasons.

Internet Explorer is a bully and likes to use a lot of memory when it is running, if you have low memory on your PC 256mb or less, it is vital that you close any other open applications you might have running while trying to play.

This will give you a good performance boost.

If you have higher memory, there are a few things that might slow you down, one of them is IM programs ... . Instant Messenger programs look like small harmless things and on the most part they are however I recently had a run in with MSN and found it to be using over 120mb of my system memory (on a 512mb machine that already has 200mb in use from Windows thats a lot) .... if you are running an Instant Messenger, I recommend closing it down (and by that I mean also closing its System Tray icon) and seeing if the game runs faster if it does run faster then it seems likely that the IM program is using up resources that the game would benefit from having.

I realise how useful an IM program is to a lot of players so I recommend getting Trillian, it basically allows you to chat with most of the other IM programs without having them installed. I installed Trillian with no problems, it took up my MSN contact list and I can talk fine with my MSN contacts and whats more it does all of that for a fraction of the resources MSN was taking up. You can get Trillian from the homepage at [http://www.ceruleanstudios.com](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/) [](http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/).

If you are running any programs or applications that are online, like streaming music, video or downloading over the internet the game WILL run slower unless you are on Cable or a good DSL connection. Closing them down or waiting for them to finish before playing the game is a recommended idea.

Other reasons for slowness include Virus/Spyware infections, these might be doing things to your computer in the background without you knowing it and taking system resources, you should consider scanning your PC for problems.  
You can get a great free online virus scan at [http://housecall.trendmicro.com/](http://housecall.trendmicro.com/) [](http://housecall.trendmicro.com/) (will slow your PC down while you run it of course).

Also if you have scheduled tasks on your PC and your computer/game runs slow at certain times of the day it seems likely that these tasks are conflicting with the game/PC and you should reschedule them using the Scheduled Tasks link in your Control Panel, or perhaps you have an Anti-virus program scheduled to run and do a full system scan daily. This would slow things down.

Finally make sure you dont have adware or other non-virus type infections on your PC, i've tried most of the big name detectors for such things and often found they fall short of identifying and fixing all of the problems.

I recommend something called Xoftspy [http://www.paretologic.com/xoftspy/](http://www.paretologic.com/xoftspy/) [](http://www.paretologic.com/xoftspy/)I switched to it a year or more ago when I got an adware infection that Adaware and Spybot couldnt fix and since then Xoftspy has done a tireless job detecting and fixing problems.

Those are all the tips I can think of atm. I hope this helps !
