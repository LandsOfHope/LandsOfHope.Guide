This could happen if you have turned WindowsÂ high contrast mode on, which evidently turns off the background images and may affect colors.

Below are instructions for turning it off and correcting the problem:

**Windows XP Users**

*   Open the Control Panel.
*   Double-click the Accessibility Options icon.
*   In the Accessibility Options window click the Display tab.
*   Check the box to Use High Contrast.

**Windows Vista Users**  
By default Windows Vista has the ability to turn on and off the High Contrast color scheme by pressing and holding **ALT, the left Shift, and the Print screen** key all at the same time. If you wish to manually adjust settings such as displaying a warning message when entering this mode or disabling this feature follow the below steps.

*   Open the Control Panel.
*   In the Control Panel double-click the Ease of Access Center icon.
*   Click the Set up High Contrast icon.
*   From within this window you'll be able to adjust all the High Contrast color scheme settings.
