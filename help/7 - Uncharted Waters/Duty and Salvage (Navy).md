The Salvage NPC at Hunter Hold does have trophy quests but they do not become available until level 50, this means you can not access them until the expansion is properly released.

The quests are used in conjunction with the Duty skill you get when you evolve into the level 50 Navy class evolution.

The Salvage NPC will ask you to recover some cargo from a sunken ship, to do this you have to go to the coordinates the NPC told you to go to then click the Duty button (looks like an anchor in the bottom bar and only shows up past level 50).

You will then be presented with an overhead view of the seafloor where your ship is located, you then play a mini-game similar to the needle in a haystack game where you click on the tiles on the sea floor to try to find the cargo. You have 10 default tries to find it and you can try again after your tries are up, when you do find the cargo take it back to the NPC and hand it over for your reward.

Note: Duty skill will allow for one additional try every 500 skill points. I.e. someone with 5000 skill will have 20 tries instead of 10.

You can repeat these quests as many times as you wish and there may be other ships not listed that provide other bounty when you find them in this method.
