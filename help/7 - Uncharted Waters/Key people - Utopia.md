Utopia is only accessible once your faction has gained control of the islands,  so these NPCs are not available all the time unless your faction rules the roost.

**Thea Thanoria  
**A marketeer, the only one to be found in Shrouded Isles.

**Alistair Nitt**  
A store owner, he may have a few quests for you and can sell you level 20 goods.

**Judy Witt**  
Co owner of a supply store along with Alistair, she may have some quests as well as level 10 goods.

**Lily Blackpowder**  
A firey personality matches her flaming red hair and her expertise in fireworks and explosives, one might say she was born to blow things up but then if one said that near her they\`d probably wake up to find a firecracker going off under their bed. Not that I know this from experience ....

**Emma Charles  
**Emma is an appraiser and can get your items identified for you, she is as smart as they come because of this and probably knows what color your underpants are simply by seeing you walk into her store. Yes she is that good!

**Frederick Cornwell**  
A postman, about as dull and boring as possible ... although I am sure if you asked nicely he could recount fascinating stories of oddly addressed envelopes!

**David Jones**  
A dealer of pets, can buy your old and decrepid pets from you or stable your pet in the luxury it deserves.

**Sam Westerfield**  
A quest master, the best place to go to get new quests and complete any outstanding quests you have with him.

**Wilma Watts**  
Wilma is a skill trainer and can teach you in the ways of Beachcombing and Bejeweling. Although one would have thought Beachcombing is as easy as walking up and down a beach it is not so ... it is very difficult and only those trained in the art can do it ... besides you need the right comb!

**Billy Watts**  
Billy is skilled in many forms of combat and can teach you various combat styles.

**Greg Grog**  
The owner of the Groggy Moggy quality tavern.

**Molly Coddles**  
The cook in the kitchen at the Groggy Moggy ... she cooks a mean souffle!
