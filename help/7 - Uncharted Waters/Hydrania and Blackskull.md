As well as being a Pirate/Navy member you can also choose to access additional content by joining forces with either the Sea Goddess HydraniaÂ or Blackskull.

Hydrania is in charge of the well being of the ocean in general terms, she takes great pride in ensuring the oceans are kept in harmony with the rest of the world. She is also the deity you should pray to to ensure a safe journey when traveling by sea, she is reputed to be kind and tolerates humanities use of the oceans as long as they are not harmful.

Blackskull is not so nice, he was a man once, but his overwhelming urge to gain power led to his accidental use of one too many magical spells that forced his body to reject his flesh. Fearing a rather gruesome end he threw himself into the ocean and hoped a quick death would put an end to his suffering, the water reacted with his magic in two ways:

*   It amplified the spells effects and forced almost all of his flesh to be consumed.
*   It quenched his pain and turned him into an undead.

Blackskull found his new form to be appealing as it allowed him to do almost anything without risk of death, his only weakness is that he is weakened whenever he leaves the safety of the water.

Many of the oceans inhabitants have become victims to Blackskull\`s need for power, he has been slowly building an army by sinking vessels all through the Shrouded Isles and converting the drowned to his ranks.

Hydrania and Blackskull are essentially at war, with Hydrania attempting to protect the ocean from his evil corruption and Blackskull simply trying to eradicate all traces of anything that will threaten his power.

It is also rumored that Hydrania\`s obsession with destroying Blackskull has led her relationship with the Sea King to become strained, while the Sea King does not tolerate the actions of Blackskull he also does not approve of some of the methods Hydrania has taken to best Blackskull.

Note: Both these elements are still under construction and will not be 100% finished for the preview, although it will be possible to do some of the Hydrania quests the Blackskull quests will not be finished in time and may not even be ready for launch.

**How do I help either side?**  
When you rest Hydrania or Blackskull may visit you and offer you more clues on how to serve them. This is a random action such as being bitten in the normal game, so it may take a lot of resting to trigger these story arcs.

This only works if you are below level 100 if you have no chosen to side with Hydrania or Blackskull before level 100 you will not receive this rest event after level 100.
