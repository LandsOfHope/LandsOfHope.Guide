You can trade vessel items to another player, the only vessel items that can be traded are:

*   Cargo items (things you loot off vessels)
*   Seamanship crafted items.

You can not trade faction rewards or other items you may have gained for your vessels. You can also not trade doubloons as that would provide too much of an advantage at this time.

1.  To trade items to another vessel simply locate the vessel (pre-arranged meeting with vessel owner).
2.  Mouse over the vessel and click the "Trade" button.
3.  Select the vessel that has the cargo you wish to trade from in the popup box that comes up, by clicking on the vessel.
4.  Use the Trade screen to select the goods from your vesselÂ to trade to the target.
5.  Click the Trade button to complete the trade.

As long as the targeted vessel has room for the items they will be transferred and the person you traded to will receive a message.

**Please note you can only trade items to people in the same faction as you, there is no Navy to Pirate or Pirate to Navy transfers allowed.**
