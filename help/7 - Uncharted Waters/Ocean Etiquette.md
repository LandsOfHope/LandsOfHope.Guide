Here are some general guidelines which will make your time on the ocean a much better place:

*   If you move to a tile and see another player owned vessel you should assume that person is fighting on that tile,
    *   If this is a quest tile i.e. one location where a specific type of vessel spawns for a quest then it should be considered first person to sink it wins ....
    *   If this is a standard water tile, please let the first person continue and instead move to another tile. After all they were there first, and it would be mean of you to take away that fact by killing things they are fighting.
*   If you disable a vessel please destroy the vessel, otherwiseÂ it will wait until another player destroys it or it despawns. You can destroy a vessel by any of the following actions:
    *   Plundering it (pirate)
    *   Impounding it (navy)
    *   Scuppering it (all)
