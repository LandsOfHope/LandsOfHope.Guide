Randomly at least once a Day the Sea King will stir the oceans into a frenzy and send Storm Fronts chasing after vessels.

If your vessel can outrun the storm front using its "Vessel Speed" attribute then you will suffer no ill effects, if however your vessel is not as fortunate to out run the storm front you may find that you lose an item to the briney deep!

The storm front will only affect some vessels that have been active in the last few minutes and not all, when the storm hits you will see a message in your status window if you suffered item loss or survived, or if a storm didnt come near you you will get no message.

This adds a function to the Vessel Speed skill for vessels, the higher your speed the more chance you have of out running the storm front!
