Randomly once a day for the forseeable future a portal will open in a random town in the game, a bunch of demons will come through and cause mischief.

**When you see the notice in the status window of an invasion you have five minutes from the time of that notice to kill the demons to get a key, after which time the demons will automatically despawn and you will have to wait until the next invasion.**

Killing a demon will give you a key to the Demon Realm. Once you use the Key the realm will be unlocked for your character and you can enter the realm and partake in the Demony goodness.

**About the Demon Realm  
**A long time ago there existed gods who watched the mortal realms, one of these gods known as Ilandria looked into the minds of the other gods and found one who was hell bent on evil and destruction, she shared her findings with the others and it was agreed to banish the evil one to a place where he could not harm the developing world.

Ilandria was made to stand watch over this evil god for all of time and act as his jailer. Millions of years have passed since this time and the people of Myzan have grown up and evolved beyond Ilandria\`s wildest dreams.

Unfortunately the bonds that hold Sakure in his prison have weakened over the millenia and now every 100 years Sakure is able to open portals to Myzan and send his minions into the world to wreak havoc and to try to find a way for him to finally break free.

**Where do I fit in?**  
If you gain entry to the demon realm you can choose to side with Sakure and help him escape the prison, or you can choose to side with Ilandria and help her keep Sakure and his minions from escaping the bonds of the Demon Realm.
