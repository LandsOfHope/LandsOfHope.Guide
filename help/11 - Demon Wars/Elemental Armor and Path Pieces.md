A new update has been made to the Demonic Plains realms. The NPCs inside the Temple at Path now have new quests.

You can turn in Guardian spirits and Brotherhood blood for path pieces, these in turn can be traded at another NPC for Elements.

You can also trade Elements to another new NPC here to gain Elemental armor.

**What is Elemental Armor?**  
Elemental is a new form of cloth armor that does not come with any Armor defense rating, instead it comes with two magic resistance skills. There are 5 different armor pieces and 8 different magic resistance skill combinations available.

This will make it easier to fight against magic users, although with the lack of armor you may find the magic user turns around and stabs you in the chest with no resistance.
