Within the Demon Realm there is a machine that the Demons stole on a previous trip through the portal to Myzan, the Machine was made by a very smart tinkerer and can actually be used to control the weather!

The machine uses crystals as a power supply, and these particular crystals can only be found in the Demon Realm.

The machine takes nine crystals all together and you can use these in different configurations producing different effects .... experimentation will be required to figure out the different effects.
