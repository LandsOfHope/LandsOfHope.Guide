The Manage NPCs screen is used to add/delete and edit NPCs that you have placed on the selected tile by clicking the NPC button at the bottom of the screen when standing on a tile you own.

The same screen (or very similar) can also be accessed via the Edit NPCs button on the Manage Buildings screen but allows you to edit NPCs inside buildings on the tile you own rather than on the tile itself.

This mode allows you to change the texts and speech the NPC will use when interacted with which truly allows you to make your land tile unique.

You can click the preview button to have the text sent to the status window as a test and then click the Save button when you are happy with the changes.

**Race Mode**  
This mode allows you to change the race of the NPC. There is quite a comprehensive list of humanoid races to use and changing the race will automatically change the picture.
