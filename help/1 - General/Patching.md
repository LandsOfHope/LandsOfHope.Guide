While you do not have to patch the game to play it, we are constantly adding new content to the game this is often done in the background without any interruption to game play.

Sometimes it is necessary to update core files, these are an integral part of the game and patching them will produce errors. It is not that the game is broken it is merely that the file is unaccessible while it is being patched.

Essentially I upload a new copy of a file from my machine to the server, the moment the upload starts it locks the current file on the server which causes an error each time the file is accessed. Once the upload is complete unless there is an error in the new code it will return to working normally.

Typically when patching a core file it will take up to 10seconds to upload the file, so there may be a few seconds when you get these errors.

Watch out for announcements in chat as they usually inform you of a patch, as stated patching the core files is usually very rare.
