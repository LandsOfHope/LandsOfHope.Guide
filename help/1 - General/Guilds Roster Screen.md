The roster screen can be accessed by all members of the guild and provides a list of all of the people in the guild.

Aside from using the list to review the level and status of people in a guild it can also be used for management purposes to visually see when a player was last active and perhaps then use the edit screen to remove the person from the guild if they have been inactive for a long time.
