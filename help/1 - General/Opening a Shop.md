If you have decided to go into business selling goods and items to other players the first thing you will need is a base of operations. This means you will need a shop or a shop type room to base your business out of.

A full list of applicable shop types is available via the link at the bottom of this help topic.

**Hiring a Vendor**  
Once you have acquired your shop you need to hire your first vendor. Enter the shop room you wish to place a vendor in then click the "A" dminister button at the bottom of the game window it should show the following screen.

The choice of races available to you on the hire screen depends on both your allegiance and your level the default vendor is Human but at higher levels you can get different vendors.

The higher level vendors have a larger inventory capacity which means you can sell more items on less vendors.

Choose your preferred Shopkeeper and click the Hire button to purchase your vendor. You have to pay a small fee to get the vendor but there are no other fees to worry about.

**Pricing Goods**  
Before you trade your goods to your vendor it is recommended you price them. While you can price items after trading there is a chance that between trading the items and pricing them someone may buy the item for the default price and you will lose out on money.

_To price your items go to the Inventory > Actions > Price screen._

**Managing the Vendors**  
Now that you have placed your shopkeeper you can use the Minions > Manage > Vendors screen to manage your shopkeepers and vendors.

You can rename your vendors and do a number of other things via this screen. The most important vendor buttons are explained below..

*   Info, display information on the selected Vendor.
*   Dismiss, dismiss the vendor (any items held by the vendor are deleted).
*   Rename, rename the vendor.
*   Take Items, used to take items from the vendor.
*   Price, used to price the items on the vendor.
*   Trade, used to trade items to the vendor.
*   Normal, used to switch between the player vendor and shopkeeper titles for the vendor.
*   Other, used to switch between the player vendor and shopkeeper titles for the vendor.

**Managing Sales**  
When you make a sale through a vendor you actually receive the money instantly so you do not have to worry about taking money from your vendors as they never have any.

You will get daily sales reports in your status window when you login which outline how many sales you have made that day.

For more indepth analysis of your sales you can visit the Character > Statistics > Sales screen and see what sells the best and how much money you have made.

_Note: The Sales screen only covers sales from the last month (the same time frame the ranking pages cover)_

**Marketing and Advertising**  
No marketing or advertising is really needed of course they do say no advertising is bad advertising so advertising your goods won\`t hurt either.

When you place something on your vendor it automatically shows up on the marketeer screen which means anyone searching for an item that matches an item on one of your vendors will have instant access to that item from any marketeer in the game.

**Remember you are a slave to the wants and desires of players so try to stock useful items that people want.**
