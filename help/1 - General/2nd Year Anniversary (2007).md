**What do the items do?**  
The paintings have no use aside from looking neat (thanks Zusa), use the furnishing screen to place a painting into your galleria room/building to put your paintings on display.

The tomato plant, can be placed into an arboretum room and produces tomato soup at a rate of 10 bowls of tomato soup every 20minutes. _Tomato soup is a health regenerating food item._

The pepper plant, can be placed into an arboretum room and produces stir fry at a rate of 10 plates of stir fry every 20 minutes. _Stiry fry is a mana regenerating food item._

(both these items can be consumed in combat)

The chili plant produces spicy hot chili \* 2 which can be consumed to gain a temporary cold survival bonus.

The 2 year gift plant can be placed onto a tile you own using the Tile Items screen, when clicked on the plant produces a special message.
