Once a day or perhaps once every 2 days a random event occurs in Lands of Hope, a magical palace descends from the skies and lands for one of the players online at the time.

This palace can only be entered by the player it landed for, inside you will find a dungeon full of evil Genie monsters who wish to kill you.

Killing the boss in the dungeon gets a pretty neat earring as well as bragging rights!

The Genies will also drop magic genie dust which can be used in a future trophy quest, so watch out for the Floating Palace as it might just land on you!

The palace can spawn for anyone of any level with the following limitations:

*   Does not spawn for someone who is not in one of the 10 normal realms, this means Battlefield, Juratania, Eastern Lands, Shrouded Isles, Eternal Plains, Challenge Realms are not going to end up with a palace inside them. This is due to the fact these realms use special spawn routines.
*   Does not work for someone on the Estate.
*   Player has to be logged into the game at the random time it runs.
