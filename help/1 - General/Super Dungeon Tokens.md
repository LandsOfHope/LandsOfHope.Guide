A super dungeon tokens is a special item gained in certain player made dungeons. These are a reward for completing DM Quests that the owner of the dungeon has created.

To find a dungeon with such quests go to World > Dungeons, and look for dungeons with the Q - Quest Bonus listed.

Once you enter the dungeon look for the Quest Room which should contain instructions on how to complete the quest.

A super dungeon token can be used at a Super prize chest (should be found in the same dungeon, although any super prize token will work at any super prize chest).

The reward gained from a Super prize chest is adjustable the same as ones gained from normal prize chests.
