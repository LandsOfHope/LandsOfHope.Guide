When you look up an item in the Library > Items screen it will often have a formula next to it. This formula contains a variable R that is not listed anywhere.

R relates to the rarity of the item and is expressed as a number.

There five different rarities but each rarity may cover several numerical values on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being the least rare and 10 being the most rare.

*   **Common**, rarity value 0 or 1
*   **Uncommon**, rarity value 2, 3 or 4
*   **Rare**, rarity value 5, 6 andÂ 7
*   **Very rare**, rarity value 8, 9
*   **Unique**, rarity values 10

This means that there can be a slight variance between one common and another identical common if the rarity value is different.

_i.e. a rarity of 0 would mean no bonus from the rarity bonus but a rarity of 1 would mean a bonus of 5._
