If you are lucky enough to obtain a blessing/curse room (drop only) dungeon mastery deed, you can add new content to your dungeons.

**Blessing Room**  
When a player enters a blessing room it will cast a special blessing spell on that person (maximum of one spell every 5 minutes per room). This will raise their stats based on the spell the dungeon master has placed in the room.

**Curse Room**  
When a player enters a curse room it will cast a curseÂ  spell on that person (maximum of one spell every 5 minutes per room). This will lower their stats based on the spell the dungeon master has placed on the room.

**General Notes**  
You can have up to two blessing/curse rooms per dungeon, in general I would recommend placing a blessing room after a boss at the end of the dungeon and a curse room anywhere in the dungeon you think it would fit.

Right now there is a limited selection of spells which debuff/buff health with more varied spells planned if the system proves popular.

**How to set these spells?**  
If you are a Dungeon Master go stand inside the blessing/curse room and click the button at the bottom of the screen for administering your blessing/curse room. (Looks like a cloud with a sun behind it).
