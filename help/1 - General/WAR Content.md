Our world may never be the same again as WAR is upon us!

The Exiles and Society have moved their prized Artifacts away from the normal realms and locked them away at the bottom of a deep dark Keep Dungeon!

Both sides believing they were now safe from assault had a rude awakening when they realized they had built their Keeps not more than a 7 miles from each other!

To rub salt into the wound the Reapers also built a Keep nearby and placed their Sacred Mask inside ... in what may very well be the battle to end the WAR the Neutrals also erected a fortress to protect their interests and ensure they have a say in things once the dust and blood has settled!

All Level 900s will be able to participate in Artifact sieging, and the other features of this new **FREE** content pack!

_Releasing Friday 6th August ...._
