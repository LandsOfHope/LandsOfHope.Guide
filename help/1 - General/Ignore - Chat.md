When ignoring someone in chat the chat system formerly replaced that persons line with the text "TEXT BLOCKED", this was so that chat did not appear to be broken.

However it appears no one wants this and would rather have the chat system remove the line of text completely, the side effect of this is that while someone you have ignored is speaking it will basically remove that persons line from your chat completely making it seem like chat is broken as you could potentially have 20 blank lines.

Because of this I have made this help topic to explain it is what YOU ALL wanted and not something I care for.
