**Chat Client**  
You can use this setting to turn the shoutbox on or off. With the shoutbox off you will not be able to chat in real time with people however you can still play the game and send messages to people using the Character > Messages system.

**Your Chat Handle**  
You can change your chat nickname here byÂ typing the name you wish to use. You may only use a name in chat if you have a character with that name or a pet with that name ... this is designed to stop people impersonating other players.

**Shoutbox Color  
**You can temporarily change the color you chat with by clicking the small colored squares to the right of the chat box but if you wish to make it so you always use a color and don\`t have to change it manually you can set the default color you use by choosing one of the colors here.

_You can change the color as many times as you want._

**Chat box Width**  
This entry box allows you to set the physical width in pixels of the chat box. This allows you to give as much or as little room to the shoutbox as you think is necessary.

The recommended width of the box is your desktop screen resolution divided by two such as:

*   800 \* 600, Your recommended width would be 400.
*   1024 \* 768, Your recommended width would be 512

Although you can set it to whatever width you feel comfortable with.

The Status Window will use up whatever space is left so if the status window is looking squished or too small it will be because this setting is too big.

_Note: Changing this setting will cause the game window to refresh._
