I really dont want to have to make this post, as I think we have a pretty great community but I think in the end a post like this is probably a good measure.

When you are in chat, and firing off half a dozen questions a second to people, remember that those people are either just like you (playing the game to have fun) or are Moderators (who do not get paid, and answer questions only if they feel like it) or a GM (i.e. Decius) who while he does make money from the game he doesnt earn enough money to be anyones private servant.

Personally I am more than happy to answer questions, and I know many other people are too but you have to remember to be nice and thank people for their time and effort, and ask your question nicely, people will be far nicer to you when you are nice to them.

It is hard to answer a ton of questions when the person asking them is not being very kind in the process.

Remember once you know the game better, you might feel like being someone who answers questions a lot, how are you going to feel when someone is just rudely firing off questions without any kind of thanks or gratitude in the process.
