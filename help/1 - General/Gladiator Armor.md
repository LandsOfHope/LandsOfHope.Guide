The special Gladiator Armor pieces now have a charge limit per fight, the charge limit is Charges = ((Armor Item Level / 50) + 2).

This means a level 5 armor piece will have 2 charges, a level 55 armor piece will have 3 and a level 1000 armor piece will have 22 charges.

This total is per fight, the charges reset for the next fight so its not like you have to refill the batteries!
