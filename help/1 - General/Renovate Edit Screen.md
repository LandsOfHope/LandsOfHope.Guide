The renovate edit screen allows you to rename your rooms and add a small textual description that everyone will see when they enter your room..

The different settings are as follows:

*   Name, the name of the room. _If you wish to rename your entire building renaming the entrance room will have that desired effect._
*   Description, the small description you wish people to see when they enter this room or building.
*   Marker, adds a purple bouncing arrow to that room it is primarily used as a marker to indicate something of importance in the room.

The save button will store the changes you have made.

**You will have to exit and re-enter the building for the room name change to show up on the mini-map.**
