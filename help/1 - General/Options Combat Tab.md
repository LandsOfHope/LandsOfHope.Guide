**Go to Loot screen**  
With this option checked after you complete a fight you will be taken straight to the Loot screen so you can loot it etc ...

With the option unchecked the fight will end and you will be taken back to the main screen where you can either manually click the corpse or just ignore it and go about your way.

_Note: Not destroying a corpse will probably annoy other people in the area as nothing can spawn on that tile/room until the corpse is destroyed which if you don\`t do it will take between 5 and 10 minutes._

**Hide ammo messages**  
Checking this box will prevent ammo use and warning messages to show up in combat. If you are using a ranged weapon such as a bow you will normally receive notices letting you know how much ammo is left so you know when you are almost out and need to get more.
