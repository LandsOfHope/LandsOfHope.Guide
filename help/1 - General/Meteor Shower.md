Once a day at a random time there will be a Meteor Shower, Myzan will be hit by up to 20 meteorite fragments that will land in the standard level 1 to 1000 realms (JW, DE, UW, Challenge Realms and EP not included).

While anyone can pick a meteorite up they are only able to be used by the forthcoming Starchaser class.

The Starchaser will have a way of tracking meteorites, so it will be easier for them to locate them rather than having to check all the tiles in the game.

Note: You may only carry one meteorite at any one time, this is because they are strange and mysterious items and carrying more than one might cause the fabric of space and time to collapse in on itself!

**After picking up a Meteorite it will last for 10hours, and then decay so you must use it quickly!**

Meteorites can be handed over to the NPCs (for rewards) inside the Springlade Observatory at 33, 58 in Knotwood Valley. Howver only the Starchaser class can access this building.

**Starlight**  
During a shower two random stealthed players who were online during the shower will be revealed and unstealthed due to the starlight. To avoid this you can be inside a building.
