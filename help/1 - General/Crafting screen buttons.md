The main crafting screen has a number of buttons on it these are explained in great detail below.

Buttons accessed after choosing a plan:

*   Ingredient Level, this button can be used to filter the ingredients available in the box at the bottom of the screen. _It is useful for players who keep a lot of resources but need to use a lower level resource._ Click the button then enter the level of the resource and it will filter the list to only display that level primary ingredient while leaving the other ingredients at defaults.
*   Ready, most of the crafting skills have several hundred plans you may not use all of those plans on a regular basis so it is possible to ready your most popular/useful plans and then click the readied button at the bottom of the screen to make it so only those plans show up.
*   Unready, returns the plan to normal status so it will no longer show up when the screen is in readied mode.
*   Private, makes this plan private. By default if someone is looking for a plan on the craft marketeer your name will show up if you know that plan and a player can get you to make the item for them if you click the private button it causes the plan to be made private and thus your name will not be available on the craft marketeer screen.
*   Public, the opposite of private. If you have made a plan private you can make it public again by clicking this button.

Buttons at the bottom of the screen:

*   Craft, shows the craft skill selection screen.
*   Inventory, shows your inventory screen.
*   Stack, stacks your inventory.
*   Shortcut, loads the Character > Shortcuts screen and lets you create a shortcut to an Alchemy skill plan. This allows you to click a button on your shortcut bar no matter what you are doing to have the craft screen shown with that plan loaded.
*   Readied, shows only the plans you have selected and readied using the ready button. Click the all button to turn this off.
*   All, shows all plans regardless of readied state.
*   Types, shows the list of plans with a list of plan types useful to find a specific type of item.
*   Slot, shows the list of plans with a list of the slot the completed item equips to.
*   Queue, shows the Inventory > Queue screen.
