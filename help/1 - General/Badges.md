As you play the game you may acquire special "badges" these are items gained as special rewards from completing faction events and other special tasks.

These are mainly intended for bragging rights as you collect all of the badges and work towards having a full set of badges, however it may also be possible to gain special rewards from getting these badges.

To find out what rewards are available go to File > Trophies Earned and it will list the badges and other special faction trophies you have earned.

Using a badge you have earned to gain a reward does not use the badge up, so you do not have to worry about holding out for a higher rank reward.

**Monthly Challenge Reward  
**The challenge (no pun intended) with coming up with a monthly challenge winners reward is that the reward has to both be useful yet offer some reason for a player to attempt to win the challenge again for their faction, after all if the reward was a useable item such as a ring or a necklace or similar once a player had gained it once there would be no real insentive to take part in the challenge again except to earn it on another character ... although the general faction rewards should also be a nice insentive.

So I went with a reward for the monthly challenges that is both cool and repeatable in this case the challenge reward is a badge which unlocks various titles (different to each faction).

Right now this means to get the rank 5 faction you have to complete the challenge 5 times with the winning side, this should ensure active participation for months to come.

**Special Trophies Note**  
It is possible that the rewards you earn can require multiple badges from different events so it may also mean that we can create special rewards for winning both a Halloween Badge and a Challenge Badge etc ...
