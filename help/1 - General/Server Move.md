**Server Update**  
On or around the 1st of November the Game Server will be moved from commercial world class hosting to being hosted inside my office.

This will result in slightly slower gameplay, although I have built a nice server rig specially for this task my internet connection is not as fast as the one at the Data Center where LOH is presently hosted.

I have tried my best to delay this action but I am at a crossroads right now, either I keep paying for the server hosting and throw away more money or I initiate saving mode and save myself 350+ dollars a month.

When the current server is turned off all databas and website files will be transferred to the new server so it should be like nothing happened, in addition all Domain names will be updated to point to the new server although this process itself might take 24 - 48 hrs to go through as domain names can take a fair amount of time to filter through when you make changes.

Thank you all for your support the last ten years, I hope you enjoyed playing my games as much as I did coding them and I hope that sometime in the future when the Economy picks up perhaps you will consider spending money on my projects once more.

**Additional Comments**  
When the move takes place I will be trimming dead weight and removing parts of my services no longer used this means the following segments will be deleted:

*   Forums - I believe I am the only one who uses the forums.
*   Champion of the Gods - I liked this game but its only made 15 or so dollars in the last 3 months and thats not good.
*   Newspaper / Card Game - Jury is still out on both of these, one may be lost while the other may survive who knows.

You can test the speed of the new server at [http://67.236.161.174/](http://67.236.161.174/)
