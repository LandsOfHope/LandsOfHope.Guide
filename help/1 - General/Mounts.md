Certain pet races are considered Mountable, this means you can ride them like for example riding a horse.

Tip: For a full list of the mountable races go to Library > Races > Mounts.

If you have a mountable pet, go to Minions > Manage then click on the Pet and click the Mount button (if you see Dismount it means you are already riding it).

When you mount a pet you may gain access to special mount buffs of which there are two varieties:

*   Automatic, this means when you mount you gain a specific buff spell automatically without having to do anything.
*   Manual, manual spells can be activated via Character > Mount Bonuses.

Some races have several manual spells, and you are permitted to have up to 3 mount spells active at any one time, however if you dismount the spells are automatically terminated.

As well as the mount spells you will find any mount provides a 20% boost to Maximum health, and a 5% boost to both spell and physical evasion skills.

Note: There are no penalties to using a mount, you do not need to dismount to fight.
