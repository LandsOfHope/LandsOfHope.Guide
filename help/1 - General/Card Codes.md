The common and rare card codes found in this game can be used in the new card game that Decius (the maker of this game) released late in January 2009.

These codes have one use and you can choose to keep them for yourself or sell them to other players.

To redeem your codes make a note of the code or copy and paste it using Ctrl + C.

Then open the card game at [http://www.forlornonline.com/cardgame/](cardgame/) and login using your Lands of Hope account details, enter your code at the bottom of the account screen.

Once a code is used it will be deleted from the game!

Tip: Winona Shadowkind at 31, 59 inside the Genie Lantern has a series of quests to unlock specific card codes.
