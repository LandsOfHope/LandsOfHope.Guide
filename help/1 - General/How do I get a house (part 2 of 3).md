3\. Determine the materials needed to construct the house.

  

Once you have selected a building, go to the Marketeer (one is outside Springlade at 31,59 KV).  Click the Craft button, and type the name of the building you have selected.  Select the deed (not the blueprint) of the building you chose, and click Components.  You will then see the resources required to construct this building.  Usually, the resources include bricks, ingots, and/or planks.

  

While you may want to build a very large building, know that larger buildings will require considerably more resources.  For instance, a palace (the largest craftable building) requires 200 planks, 200 bricks, and 100 ingots.  A canvas tent (one of the smaller buildings) requires only 15 planks.  If you find that your selected building takes more materials than you are willing to make, you may want to return to step 2 and select a smaller building. 

4\. Obtain the materials needed to construct the house.

  

For planks, you will need to use LUMBERJACKING to gather logs, and CARPENTRY to turn those logs into planks (each log creates two planks). 

  

For ingots, you will need to use MINING to gather ore, and BLACKSMITHING to turn that ore into ingots (each ore creates two ingots).

  

For bricks, you will need to use MINING to gather stone blocks, GEOLOGY to gather gems, and STONEMASONRY to create bricks (each brick requires three stone blocks and one gem).

  

If you are missing any of these skills, you can learn them at the appropriate skill trainer.  The list of skill trainers can be found using Help > Manual > Knotwood Valley.

  

You will also need the plank, ingot, and brick plans.  These plans can be learned at the plan trainers, which are located at the same place as the corresponding skill trainer.

  

Additionally, you will need tools to perform these gathering and crafting tasks.  Tools can be found at the General Store, which is located INSIDE Springlade at 31,59 KV.  You will need the following:

\* A pickaxe for mining ore and stone

\* A smiths hammer for making ingots

\* A gem hammer for mining gems

\* A hatchet for gathering logs 

\* A woodwork tool for making planks

\* A masons tool for making bricks

  

To locate the materials on the map, use the World > Resources screen, select the resource type you are looking for, and scroll around the map until you find one.  See the help topic "Using the Resource Map" for more information about this screen.

  

To create the planks, ingots, and bricks, use the Inventory > Tradeskill screen.  Select the appropriate crafting skill (carpentry, blacksmithing, stonemasonry), then select the item you want to create.  If all the Requirements are listed in green, then clicking on the Assemble button will create the desired item.  You may need to use the Stack button to put similar items into a single pile. A brick requires three stone blocks, and the blocks will not stack themselves into piles of three or more, unless you click the Stack button.
