The Resource map has been replaced with the Resources tab.

The resources tab is a pretty looking button on the right side of the screen below your character information.

Using the resources tab you can plot convenient map markers straight onto your main map to find resources such as:

*   Fishing (fish)
*   Farming (crops and fiber)
*   Foraging (fruit and vegetables)
*   Mining (ore and stone)
*   Geology (gems)
*   Lumberjacking (logs)

While you can stumble around blindly trying to find the above resources using the Resources tab is much quicker and easier not to mention spifier!

Each resource is listed above together with the skill that is required to gather it. There are some of the above resources on each map but the location of the resources is relative to the type of resource being gathered. This means you are not going to find vegetables on water tiles or fish on land tiles however you can use the Compass button at the bottom of the game screen to move your displayed map view around to find resources in other parts of the current map.

**Advanced Options**  
The resource bar includes 4 extra options, the Level boxes allow you to enter a start and end level range for resources you are looking for, in addition to that you can enter a material name in the box below the level entry.

Finally the drop down box can be used to choose if you are using your own gathering skill or that of a pet, the list shows pets that are following you and on the same tile.

If nothing is showing up for you on the map check the following:

*   You have enough gathering skill to find resources in the map you are on.
*   The Level range is valid for the resource you are looking for.
*   If you use a Material name make sure it is spelled correctly.
*   Make sure the drop down box is set to You or that if you are using one of your pets skills that the pet meets the above three requirements.

**General Resource Locations**

*   Fish can be found on **water**.
*   Crops/Berries/Fiber/Vegetables can be found on **land**.
*   Logs can be found in **forests**.
*   Stone/Gems and Ore can be found over **mountains** or **lava**.

For example when you are searching for ore in Knotwood Valley, most of Knotwood is grass and desert with waterways except there are mountains bordering the entire realm so use the white arrow buttons to move over towards the mountains and see what you can find.

If you do find a resource, simply click on the picture on the resource map or text listing on the right to go to the location of the resource it will show up at the bottom of the screen and you can click on it to begin harvesting.

You will need to use a tool to harvest a resource, the type of tool depends on what resource you are after.
