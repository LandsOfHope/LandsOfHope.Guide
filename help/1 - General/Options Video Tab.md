**Show lighting effects**  
Certain advanced lighting effects that Internet Explorer supports natively can be turned on using this setting. However not all computers/graphic cards can support this feature.

Predominantly turning this feature on will cause the game to use a light source when inside buildings and to dynamically light the world based on the time of dayÂ when outside of a building.
