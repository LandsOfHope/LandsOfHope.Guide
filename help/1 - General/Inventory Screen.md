The inventory screen is perhaps one of the most widely used screens in the game as it allows you to interact with items you have in your inventory.

As you can see from the above screenshot the layout of the inventory screen is very similar to that of any other screen in the game.

The left part of the screen lists all of the items in your inventory although this is done in page format due to the fact that people could have a thousand or more items in their inventory.

_You can switch between pages by clicking the page number at the top of the screen._ 

When you lick on an item to select it the right side of the screen will update to display a little bit more about the item and also have a bunch of buttons to use to interact with the item.

The default button choices are as follows:

*   Use, clicking this button will attempt to use the selected item. As there are thousands of items in Lands of Hope it is impossible to explain the different uses for all of them but needless to say this could mean:
    *   Consuming a piece of food
    *   Using a resource to start a crafting process
    *   Using a dungeon key to make a dungeon
    *   Using a magical item
    *   and much much more ...
*   Info, clicking this button will display further information on the item via a box at the bottom of the screen.
*   Disguise, clicking this button will attempt to disguise the selected item as another item. _Requires Deception class skill._ A disguised item can then be identified which makes it a handy way to raise appraisal.
*   Drop, clicking this button will attempt to drop the selected item. In some cases an additional confirmation prompt will be displayed in the Status Window before the process can be completed.
*   Inscribe, clicking this button will open an inscription screen allowing you to fit an imprint to this item. _Imprints are made with the Inscription crafting skill._ 
*   Link, clicking this button will send a clickable link to chat that allows anyone to view the selected item. This is primarily used to advertise goods you are selling but it may also be used to brag about a cool drop you found etc ...

Additional choices may also include:

*   Identify, clicking this button will attempt to identify the selected item if it requires identifying. _Identifying through the inventory screen requires the appraisal skill_.
*   Unlock, clicking this button will take you to the lockpicking screen and allow you to unlock locked boxes such as chests that you might have in your inventory. _The lockpicking skill is a class skill that the rogue class starts with._
*   Rename, clicking this button will let you rename an item. This feature is only available for some types of items such as bags and books.
*   Split, clicking this button will allow you to split the item stack into smaller amounts.
*   Uninscribe, clicking this button will remove any inscription on the selected item.
*   Inscription, clicking this button will allow you to add a short description to the item. This will show up in purple text when you use the Info button.
