The manage buildings screen is used to manage the buildings that are currently on your tile. You can access this screen by clicking the Buildings button at the bottom of the screen when standing on your tile.

The screen has a list of buildings on the left with a list of features and options on the right. Using this screen you canÂ change the following:

*   **Name**, allows you to rename any building on your land tile. _Doing this may annoy a player if they have a building on your tile so you may wish to discuss the renaming of a building with the player if you don\`t own the building you are renaming._
*   **Order**, allows you to change the order in which buildings show up on the main screen. So if you wish to make a building more important you can change its order. Lower numbers mean more importance while higher numbers mean less.
*   **Buttons**

*   **Save**, save the changes to the building.
*   **Change**, allows you to change the picture the building uses which lets you further customize the appearance of your tile.
*   **Destroy**, deletes the building from the game as a land owner you can delete any building on your tile including ones you do not own. _It is advised that you do not delete another players building without giving them the opportunity to relocate._
*   **Edit NPCs**, allows you to edit the NPCs that spawn inside the entrance room of the building.
