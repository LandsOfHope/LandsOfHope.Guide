A new system was introduced (October 2010) for Social Gifts. When you link yourself into chat players can click on your Social tab to view what kind of gifts have been unlocked for you ... these people viewing your social tab can then choose to unlock other social gifts for you.

You can not unlock your own social gifts only other players can give the gift!

The currency for unlocking these gifts is MC this is a new currency a "mini credit" and is basically a currency converted from Hope Credits. There are 10 mcs to one 1 hc.

You can convert your HCs to MCs using the Hope Credit screen (via Account screen).

Not all gifts may be good, some might indicate character flaws or simply a cookie personality!

Gifts are non-refundable, non-removable, non-stick, non-environmentall friendly and may contain 25% lead!

**NOTE You can not convert MCs to HCs so once you buy your MCs you better be prepared to spend them!**
