Alright so you have worked your fingers to the bone gathering resources, you now want to turn them into something you can use in Crafting, right ? In most cases you can simply goto your Inventory screen select your gathered resource (after its done on the Inventory > Queue screen) and then click the Use button. This typically loads a screen that lets you change most items from its raw material to a crafting material. Logs - Planks Hides - Prepared Hides Ore - Ingots Fiber - Thread - Cloth etc ... To do this you will need the correct Crafting skill, which is different to a gathering skill to turn Logs into Planks you need Lumberjacking to get the Logs but Carpentry to make the Planks you may need to use lower materials to get your Carpentry skill up if you have been concentrating on a gathering skill. There are also some items around the lands that you can use such as a Chopping Saw that let you turn gathered items into craft resources these do not need skill but give you half of the resource having the skill would make. There may also be a few craft resources which are only made via the Inventory > Tradeskill menu, again you need the correct craft skill and you also need the right recipe. In general the craft recipes are 5 skill so can be gained right after you buy craft training for ease of use.
