If you have been lucky enough to purchase your own tile of land you have almost full control over the tile. The only things you can not change on the tile are the terrain, images and monster spawns for the simple reason that it may cause problems for other players if you could.

_As tiles are extremely rare and only made available in limited numbers anyone who does get a land tile should count themselves extremely lucky and dare I say it special._

As a land owner you can perform the following tasks:

*   Manage Tile
    *   Change the tile name
    *   Make the tile appear on the World > map
    *   Make tile permits (for allowing players to build or relocate to this location)
    *   Turn monster spawns on/off
*   Manage NPCs
    *   Add / Delete NPCs
    *   Change the race and profession
    *   Change the text the NPC can say
*   Manage Buildings
    *   Change the building picture
    *   Destroy buildings
    *   Rename buildings
    *   Set the order of importance
    *   Manage NPCs
        *   Add / Delete NPCs
        *   Change the race and profession
        *   Change the text the NPC can say
*   Manage Items
    *   Add / Remove world tile items
*   Manage Friends
    *   Give other players access to manage / administrate your tile and much more.

Most of these functions are accessed via the buttons found at the bottom of the main screen when standing on your tile.

_As a tile owner none of your character will show up on your tile this is intended as a benefit to allow you to administer your tile in piece without people harassing you._
