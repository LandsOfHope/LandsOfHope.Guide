Every player can own property and landÂ in Lands of Hope, I understand that some people are confused by these two terms so I will explain them from the point of view of the game.

*   Property, a building or structure.
*   Land, a tile of land (that can contain multiple properties).

You do not have to own land to have property as property can be built on both unclaimed land tiles and also claimed land tiles that the owner allows building on.

**Property Ownership**  
A player can own multiple properties with a limit of 35 at level 1000. Owning property can be achieved through one of the following ways:

*   Use a building deed to make a new building (deeds can be made through the Craft Marketeer/Construction skill or possibly bought on the Item Marketeer).
*   Buy a building using the Building Marketeer.
*   Be traded a property by another player.

**Land Ownership**  
A player can own an unlimited amount of land tiles however claiming a land tile requires either the tile to be up for sale atm (rare) or the use of a bought extra tile claiming item like the Genesis orb or Orb of Terraforming both of which are available via the File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items screen.
