5\. Obtain the building deed

  

Go back to the Marketeer (outside Springlade at 31,59 KV).  Click the Craft button, and if necessary, type the name of the building again.  Select the appropriate deed and then click Components.  If you have the required materials (they will be in green), you will see a button allowing you to build the deed.  Select a player from the next screen, and they will begin to make you the deed (using your queue).  After a short amount of time, the deed will be constructed, and you can remove it from your queue and place it in your inventory (just like you crafted it yourself)

  

6\. Construct the building

  

Go to the land tile you wish to build on.  Note that certain tiles cannot be constructed on (Springlade, Northglen, etc), and some player-owned tiles require a permit to build.  If a tile is not owned by a player, and does not have an NPC town or dungeon on it, you can probably build on it (even on water!).  In your inventory, select the deed and click Use to build your house.

  

Once you have a house, you may want to furnish or manage it.  See the help topics [Building Management Guide](manualnew.asp?search=409) and [Building Renovation Guide](manualnew.asp?search=399) for more information on those actions.
