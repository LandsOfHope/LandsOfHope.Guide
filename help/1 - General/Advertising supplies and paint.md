There is now a way to get your listings on the marketeer to show up differently to draw attention to your items for sale.

You can either buy Advertising supplies using real money/hc (File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items) or Advertising paint using ingame money (10pp).

**Advertising Supplies**  
These items are permanent, there are 6 different shades you can choose from, use the File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items screen to purchase these supplies at 5USD/1HC per color shade.

While you can own multiple shades at once the game can only apply one color to a listing at any one time so if you own multiple colors you must place all the colors you do not wish to use for this listing in a side bag leaving the color you wish to use in your backpack.

**Advertising paint**  
The same shades available for supplies are available as paint, however the paint only lasts for 30 days. So while you can access the colors without spending real money you may have to pay quite a lot of ingame money to keep repurchasing your favorite paint colors when they run out after 30 days.

To purchase paint go to 32, 62 and enter the Market of Wonders, purchase 2 Golden tickets (that equates to 10pp) then go to the far west room and speak to the paint seller.

**General Tips**  
Only one color can be applied to an individual listing, when you trade the goods you wish to sell to your vendors the game will pick whatever color you have in your backpack (ignoring your chests/other bags) and apply it to the item(s) you traded. This means you can have one item use one color and another item use a different color if you are prepared to spend a little more time swapping paint out and trading stuff in small batches.

To remove a color you must take the item from the vendor, put your paint/supplies in bags then trade it back.

**Naming rooms/tiles**  
The enhanced listing this feature provides (along with the pretty colors) uses information based on  the room the Player Vendor is in or the tile the Traveling Vendor is on (if it is an NPC rather than a Player Vendor).

So should you want pertinent information to show up on your listing you MUST name your tile something special as Grass will not sound very good on the listing, the same goes for your room naming something "Shop" is not gonna be very good while "Bobs Weapon Store" will sound a lot more impressive.

This feature also unlocks the ability for your shops to be found easier using the Enhanced shops button at the bottom of the marketeer, as well as ranking your goods above other players who do not have an enhanced listing.
