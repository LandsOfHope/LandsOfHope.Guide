Gathering cards can be done as follows:

*   Common, drop randomly as loot when killing any monster. There is a low percentage chance of a drop, but then players usually kill several hundred monsters each a day so you should get several cards (at least) in this time period. **Any monster has a chance to drop any card.**
*   Uncommon,Â are gained as a drop item from battered chests, there is a reasonably low chance of a card dropping.
*   Rare, these cards are gained by matching 4 card symbols when playing the 2gp scratch card game.
*   Really Rare, these cards are gained by matching 4 card symbols when playing the 10gp scratch card game (may also be gained from bought extra card packs).
*   Hero, these cards drop as random loot on hero monsters. **Any hero monster has a chance to drop any hero card (may also be gained from bought extra card packs).**
*   Ultra Rare, you can get random ultra rare cards from purchasing a special pack of cards via the File > Buy Extras screen.
*   Artifact, these are extremely rare and valuable cards gained from getting a faction rating with an event faction.
    *   New artifact cards have been added you can get them from an NPC at the Citadel in Royal Hollow. Talk to **Cardmaster Kabadali**
*   Boss, these come from killing specific monsters found in challenge realms. Kill the boss to get its card.
