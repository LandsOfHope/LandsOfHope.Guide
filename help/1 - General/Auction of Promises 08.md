Today (December 31st 2008) at 3pm ET I will be holding an Auction of Promises in the Auction channel.  
  
**What is an Auction of Promises?**  
Traditionally an Auction of Promises is a place where invidividuals or groups of people place a service or thing up for auction with the highest bidder winning said thing.  
  
This Auction of Promises will be a special year end event and the following "promises" will be up for auction by me:  
  

1.  A custom public NPC town built by GM Decius to your specification in any of the first 10 realms.
2.  A custom public NPC dungeon built by GM Decius to your specification in any of the first 10 realms.
3.  A new monster race as chosen by you, with custom artwork drawn by Michael our race artist.
4.  A new pet race as chosen by you, with custom artwork drawn by Michael our race artist.

As with an auction those of you who wish to take part will bid on the lot of your choosing, as other players bid you may need to raise your bid until finally no further bids are made and there is a winner.  
  
This auction will be held in "real" money so that means US Dollars, all payments must be made via Google or PayPal within 24hrs of the auction completing, and your prize will be delivered ASAP (artwork may take a couple of weeks).  
  
I know a few months back there was an auction of a Land Mass with Town and Dungeon and that was very successful, however I think this auction with individual lots rather than one huge thing will prove as popular if not more so!  
  
So see you all this afternoon!  
  
P.S. We will accept proxy bids so if you wish to bid but can not be here at 3pm, send Decius/Support an ingame message stating which Lots you would like to bid on and the amount of money you would be willing to pay for those lots.
