Guilds can collectively own property a guilded property can be locked which prevents anyone but people from your guild from entering the building.

Guild properties are a great way to make a meeting area for the guild or just a place for guild people to hang out and/or store items.

*   To make a building or room you ownÂ "guilded" enter the room and click the Administer button at the bottom of the screen you should have the option for "Guilded Room" select it and click the confirmation button on the right of the screen.
*   To unguild a building or room go to the Administer screen and there should be an option to "Unguild room" select it and click the confirmation button on the right of the screen.

_Once a building has been guilded it will show up on the Guilds > Property screen so guild members can find it easily._
