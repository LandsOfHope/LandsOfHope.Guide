From time to time we hold special events, such as Christmas and Halloween events.

Also there are certain events that occur at set intervals.

*   Treasure Hunt, happens once a day at random times. You have to visit an NPC and use a Magnifying glass to search for clues. The rewards vary depending on the Hunt itself.
*   Item Hunt, happens randomly every 7 days. The location the hunt happens is a random town and you have to search the whole town for the item. The reward is a Brain Expander (an item which lets you learn a drop only spell/style or plan).

Events for Level 1000s:

*   Devourer, once a day at a random time a Devourer is spawned. These are very hard to kill monsters that might have a cool reward on them. They are minions that have broken through from the Hell Plane to our reality to seek havoc.
