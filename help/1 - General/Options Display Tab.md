_Options in red will cause the game window to be refreshed when changed._

**Show Allegiance Messages**  
If you have joined one of the three allegiances in the game (Exiles, Reapers, Society) you may notice that you receive messages when players perform actions or deeds that affect your allegiance. This typically includes sieging the forts and keeps in the level 1000 Battlefield realm but it may also include other things.

You can turn these messages off by unchecking this box.

**Hide room descriptions**  
CheckÂ this box to turn off room descriptions. When you enter a building room if their is a description for the room it will show up in your status window. _People on slower connections may find slightly improved performance when turning these off._

**Show the level map**  
Check this box to cause the mini-map window to use colors to represent the level of the monster on that tile. This is an interesting setting that changes the mini-map in such a way that some people may go insane from attempting it.

After turning this setting on instead of showing terrain colors the mini-map will use the following colors:

*   **Grey**, The monster on this tile is more than ten levels lower than your level so you will not get xp.
*   **Green**, The monster on this tile is within 10 levels of your level so you will get xp for killing it.
*   **Red**, The monster on this tile is more than ten levels higher than your level so you will not get xp.

**Show labels on buttons**  
Uncheck this box to turn off captions on buttons that have images. The purpose of this is to maximize space, you may find that some screens have buttons that appear off the edge of the screen with this option turned on.

**Show tips on buttons**  
Uncheck this box to turn off Tips and Info messages for buttons. This means when you move the mouse over a button the Tips and Info box will not tell you what it does.
