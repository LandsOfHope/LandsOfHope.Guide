There are two types of Golems.  One type is a magical creature that spawns around level 260 and can be tamed using the Ethereal Trappings skill.  The second type is a craftable pet used by the Animator profession line.  This topic describes the second type.

**What are Golems?  
**Golems are special pets.  Only Animators can craft them or use them.  These pets have higher stats and skills than most normal pets, and are the preferred combat pet for the Animator profession.  Golems are created from stone blocks and gems, and Animators begin with the skills needed to gather these resources.

**Crafting Golems**  
Both golems and the components used to craft them are non-tradable, so each Animator must learn to craft their own.  To create a golem, an Animator should examine their plans to determine the specific type of shell, coating, and upgrade needed to build a golem (although Animators can craft a gigantic shell very early, only high level golems can use it).  As the Animator\`s skill increases, new plans are learned at the Animator skill trainer (33,58 KV).  A golem\`s level depends on the level of the shell used to create it, and the stats are modified based on the type of shell and upgrade used.

**Activating Golems**  
Once the golem has been crafted, it must be activated to be usable as a pet.  Golems are activated by using the crafted golem from the inventory and then selecting a Power Crystal.  Power Crystals are also crafted using the same Animation skill used to craft the golems.  Any power crystal can be used to activate any type of golem.  The appearance and skills of the golem are largely determined by the type of crystal used.  Experiment with different crystals to find the one that creates the most useful golem for your style of play.

**Equipping Golems**  
Golems come equipped with the weapons they need to perform combat.  It is not possible to modify, upgrade, or remove a golem\`s equipment.

**Enhancing Golems**  
Using the Reformation line of spells, Animators can provide a buff to their golem pet.  Only one type of infusion (health/power/stamina) can be active on a golem at a time.  Additional infusions will cancel any currently active infusions.

**Golems in Combat  
**Animators can have multiple golems, but only one can participate in combat at a time.  Golems have taunting turned on by default, so they will be the enemy\`s primary target, and will take the damage.  Animators can attack alongside their golem, or can use the Reformation spells to provide healing to their pet.  If the golem dies, the Animator can bring them back using a spell from the Reformation spell line.

**Levelling Golems  
**Golems do not gain experience, as they are not sentient beings.  Once crafted, a golem\`s skills and stats will not grow, aside from any Reformation buffs applied by the Animator.  If a golem has outgrown its use, simply dismiss it and craft a new one.

**Golems Outside of Combat**  
Using golems to gather resources and perform other crafting skills is possible, but be aware of the limitations.  Golems do not receive experience for any actions they perform.  Golems cannot be equipped, so they can receive no bonuses to their gathering or crafting abilities.  Golems are not tradable, and are discarded when they outlive their usefulness, so any skills learned or earned by a golem will be discarded with the golem.  While it may be useful (although time-consuming) for a level 1000 golem to learn a gathering or crafting skill, it may not be worth the time or money to teach a lower-level golem these skills.
