The new menu system is much better looking than the old system, it is also much smaller and requires less system resources to run.

The menu should operate just like the old menu with one change, once a menu pops up the menu does not hide itself automatically unless one of the following actions is done.

*   You left click on a menu item to load a screen.
*   Right click on the menu.
*   Press the Escape key on your keyboard.
*   Move the mouse either to the far left or far right, inside the boxes with the dotted lines around them.
*   Move the mouse above the menu headers.

It seems you either love or hate the new way the menu works, but as you can see there are a number of ways to hide a menu should you accidentally mouse over a menu by mistake.

In general everyone does agree the new menu system looks a lot nicer than the old one.
