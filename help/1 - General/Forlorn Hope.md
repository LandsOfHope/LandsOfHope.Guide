**What is Forlorn Hope?**  
Forlorn Hope was my first online browser based role playing game, it was launched in 2002 and ran for just under 3 years. It was not as widely played as Lands of Hope and never financially viable.

**What happened to it?**  
Quite simply I made a mistake ... I began working on a new game called Lands of Hope that was meant to fix all of the problems I felt were in the first one that I could not fix in the first one due to some of these "problems" like Runestones were actually features people liked.

Forlorn Hope which had been meandering along making about 700 - 1000USD a month mainly from repeat subscriptions (as it used a 5USD per month subscription model with additional extras for sale) suddenly dropped to about 150 - 200USD a month which at that time was no where near enough money needed just to break even on server costs.

I had a choice to make ... cancel work on Lands of Hope which I felt for sure could be a huge success and concentrate on Forlorn Hope or take a big risk and cancel Forlorn Hope and release Lands of Hope .... I took the risk and released Lands of Hope which has been a huge success compared to Forlorn Hope.

I did not wish to close Forlorn Hope but ultimately the players left me no choice by cancelling their financial support.

**Will it be the same with Legends of Hope?**  
I don\`t think so, Legends is not intended as a direct replacement of Lands of Hope but a totally new game with totally different gameplay elements and a different style. Also Lands of Hope is much stronger financially, and while I am sure some people from LoH will leave to play Legends I hope that Legends will build its own playerbase external to the existing LoH one.

Although ultimately these games live and die by their players, so if after the release of Legends suddenly no one is spending any money on Lands of Hope and its income drops to unsustainable levels I will just have to reevaluate things once more.

**Diversification**  
Some of you may have noticed that I now have 3 released games, LoH, MGW and FCG my attempt here is to stick my hand into as many different game markets as possible so that should the income of one game dip the others can take the slack. Although right now MGW and FCG make me about 1.50cents a month one day perhaps I can afford to buy a cheeseburger on the back of them haha!
