The dungeon spawn screen is used to set the monsters that can spawn in a room in a dungeon. See the multi-spawn page for information on setting spawns for several rooms at once.

You can use the Pool/Races button at the bottom of the screen to switch between two different styles of view. The default style is for listing all of the races you have the skill to set in this room while the pool button lets you switch to listing all of the pools you have manually configured so you can set a room to spawn a varied array of races.

If this room currently does not have any spawn in it you are faced with one or two buttons:

*   Spawn, click this button to set the selected spawn as the spawn for the room at the default level.
*   Spawn Level, click this button to set the selected spawn as the spawn for the room but you are given the ability to set the level.
*   Use, this button only shows up when using the pool mode click it to set the selected pool as the spawn for the room.

If you are editing an existing spawn (gold text) you will have the following buttons:

*   Despawn, removes the selected spawn from the room.
*   Update Level, allows you to change the level of the spawn. Your dungeon mastery skill determines what level you can set up to.
*   Rename, allows you to rename the spawn in the room to give it a fancy/special name.
*   Male / Female, allows you to change the sex of the spawn to male or female

The buttons at the bottom of the screen can be used to access the following:

*   Delete, deletes any monsters currently spawned in your dungeon room.
*   Pools, switches to the pool selection list so you can set this room to use a pool rather than an individual spawn.
*   Races, switches to the standard selection list so you can set the room to use an individual race spawn.
*   Professions, access theÂ professions screen for setting up the profession the spawn will start as.
*   Spawn Items, access the spawn items screen for setting up what items your spawns will start with.
*   Multi spawn, access the multi spawn screen for copying a spawn to multiple rooms in a dungeon.
*   Pool list, access the spawn pools screen for configuring and adding pools.

**Spawn Profession Screen**  
The spawn profession screen is accessed by clicking the profession button at the bottom of the spawns screen.

You can use it to set the profession that the spawn monster will spawn as. The list of available professions is based on your dungeon mastery skill so the higher your skill the more professions you will see

**Multi Spawn Screen**  
The multi spawn screen is used to copy the spawn from the current room to multiple other rooms in your dungeon. To show the screen click the Multi spawn button at the bottom of the main spawns screen.

To copy a spawn to multiple rooms use the buttons in the middle of the screen to select multiple rooms or simply select them by hand by putting a check in the check box to the right of the room name on the list on the left side of the screen. When you are satisfied click the Spawn button in the middle of the screen.

The buttons in the middle of the screen perform the following:

*   Red, selects all red rooms (rooms that do not currently have a spawn).
*   White, selects all white rooms (rooms that currently have a spawn).
*   All, selects all rooms.
*   None, deselects all rooms.
*   Spawn, copies the current spawn to all of the selected rooms.

To copy a spawn to a single room select the room on the left of the screen then click the Spawn button on the right of the screen.
