The titles screen is used to manage and configure your guild titles.

Titles are used to determine a players rank/importance within the guild. The titles work on a numeric system with -1 being the lowest rank and 9999 being the highest rank.

Rather than make fixed titles I wanted to give guilds the opportunity to come up with their own ranks as I think that makes for a far more interesting system.

**Adding a new title**  
There is no button to add a new title instead the way to do it is to click on the New Recruit title, then overtype the title name and the guild level box with new information (the guild level has to be unique).

Click the Save button to add this title as a new title.

**Editing an existing title  
**To edit an existing title simply click on it on the left screen or enter the title name in the search box. You can then set the following:

*   **Title**, the name of the title. The cooler the name the more your members will love you! 
*   **Level**, the ranking level from 0 to 9998 this should be unique amongst all the guild levels. The higher the number the higher the titles importance. 9999 is reserved for the guild leader.
*   **Fame**, you can place guild NPCs inside your guild buildings which automatically promote people based on their acquired guild fame otherwise you can either use this for reference purposes for your guild membership team or simply leave it empty.
*   **Recruiter Active**, tick this box to allow this rank to be used by guild recruiter NPCs otherwise untick it to disable its use.
*   **Admin Permissions**, determines what level of administration this rank allows. 
    *   **Ranks**, members of this rank can administer titles. 
    *   **Bonuses**, members of this rank can administer guild bonuses. 
    *   **Members**, members of this rank can administer existing members. 
    *   **New Members**, members of this rank can administer new members. 
    *   **Treasury**, members of this rank can withdraw money from the treasury.

    *   **View**, members of this rank can view guild messages on the Guilds > Messages screen. 
    *   **Post**, members of this rank can post new messages on the Guilds > Messages screen.
*   Buttons
    *   **Save**, save the changes you have made to a title. 
    *   **Delete**, delete a title from your guild. Members with this title are demoted.
