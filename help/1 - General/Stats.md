Your stats will go up each time you level depending on what stats are available to your profession and your stat point distribution and stat gain may change when you evolve into a higher class choice.

You can raise your stats outside of levelling by equipping items with stat bonuses on them or casting buff spells or riding a mount  or anything else that may give a temporary boost to a stat.

Below is a list of the stats in the game:

**Dexterity  
**Dexterity is your ability to evade the following:

*   Dungeon traps and player made traps, when triggering a trap there is a button called evade which lets you attempt to evade the trap.
*   Dexterity is used in combat to determine your chance of evading a physical attack (ranged/melee)

**Combat Evasion Formula**  
Evasion Chance % = ((Dexterity / Level) \* 4)

Combat evasion is capped to no higher than 40% (although it can go as high as 50% through the rogue class Attack evasion skill) to ensure that combat isnt totally unbalanced by evasion at level 1000 this means a bonus of higher than 10000 will not really accomplish anything.

Your Dexterity stat also improves your damage when using Enchanted Weapons, Bows, Two Handed Guns or Heavy Munitions.

**Damage Bonus Formula**  
Damage = Damage + (Dexterity / 10)

This means for every 10pts you have in Dexterity you will deal 1more damage when using a Bow, Two Handed Gun or Heavy Munition weapon.

**Hitpoints**  
Your Health is used to determine when you die in combat. Each time you are hit by a spell or weapon in combat your health will go down when it reaches 0 or less you will be dead and lose the fight.

This means it is often wise to have as much health as you can so that you live longer.

_To regenerate your Health go to World > Rest_

**Intelligence**  
Your Intelligence along with your mana determine the spells you can use both in combat and out of combat and it may also be used when disarming dungeon and player made traps.

Intelligence also provides a passive bonus to your mana stat which means having more intelligence gives you more mana.

**Intelligence Bonus Effects**  
Mana = Mana + (Int)

Finally Intelligence provides additional damage to some standard damage spells using the following formula:

Spell Damage Bonus = (Int / 6) - For most spells.

or

Spell Damage Bonus = (Int / 12) - For DOTS

To see this bonus after casting a spell, mouse over it and look to see if the spell pops up a "Critical damage" tooltip.

**Mana**  
Your Mana determines what spells you may cast both in combat and outside of combat. Each time you cast a spell your mana goes down as your mana drops the spells that are available to you in combat and outside of combat are reduced accordingly.

_To regenerate your mana go to World > Rest._

**Speed  
**Speed is your ability to evade magic based attacks in combat.

**Combat Evasion Formula**  
Evasion Chance % = ((Speed / Level) \* 4)

Combat evasion is capped to no higher than 40% (although it can go as high as 50% through the Spell evasion skill) to ensure that combat isnt totally unbalanced by evasion at level 1000 this means a bonus of higher than 10000 will not really accomplish anything.

Your Speed stat also improves your damage when using Instruments, Thrown Weapons or Celestial Weapons.

**Damage Bonus Formula**  
Damage = Damage + (Speed / 10)

This means for every 10pts you have in Speed you will deal 1more damage when using a Instrument or Thrown Weapon.

**Stamina**  
Your Stamina determines what styles you may execute in combat. Each time you execute a style your stamina goes down. as your stamina drops the styles that are available to you in combat and outside of combat are reduced accordingly.

_To regenerate your stamina go to World > Rest._

Stamina also provides a passive bonus to your health stat which means having more stamina gives you more health.

**Stamina Bonus Effect**  
Health = Health + (Stamina / 5)

**Strength**  
Your Strength stat improves your damage with melee weapons and the Crossbow ranged weapon.

**Damage Bonus Formula**  
Damage = Damage + (Strength / 10)

This means for every 10pts you have in Strength you will deal 1more damage when using melee weapons or a Crossbow.

**Stat Gains**  
Ways to gain additional dexterity:

*   Level up more (assuming the stat comes from your class)
*   Equip Items with the listed Stat bonus
*   Buff spells with the Stat bonus
*   Riding a mount gives enhanced Dex, Speed and Maxhealth

To regenerate Health, Mana or Stamina use the World > Rest function.
