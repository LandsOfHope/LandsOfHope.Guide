As you gain experience and increase in level, you will find that your equipment may no longer be strong enough to quickly kill your enemies and protect you from harm.  There are several ways to obtain new equipment:

**1\. Check the local towns.**

The general store typically offers a variety of simple weapons that can be equipped.  Armor shops will offer new armor with no special bonuses.  Check World > Landmarks, and look at the NPC Outposts and NPC Towns to check the town level, which often corresponds to the quality of equipment they will offer.

**2\. Loot it from enemies of the proper level.**

Using World > Landmarks > Advanced, you can find dungeons that contain enemies at or near your level.  Many enemies have a chance to drop an unidentified item, which will usually be very close to their level.  Because these drops are random, it may take some time before you find a specific item that you can use.  Items you cannot use can be sold to a merchant, or you can sell it yourself if you own a shop.

**3\. Check the marketeer for items.**

Scattered throughout the realms are marketeers who provide a quick view at the inventory of all player-owned shops (one such Marketeer is at 31,59 KV).  By selecting a level range, and optionally providing a keyword or desired bonus, it is possible to easily find new equipment that can be purchased.  In most cases, this type of armor is superior to what you will find in the local towns, and specific bonuses can also be selected to suit your particular needs.

**4\. Use the marketeer to craft the item.**

The same marketeers that provide access to player shops also allow you to have items crafted for you.  Click the Craft button at the bottom of the Marketeer's screen and type in the name of the item you would like crafted.  A complete list of items is available in the Library > Items menu.  To have an item crafted, you will be required to have the proper materials for the item, and will pay a nominal fee.  Even if you don't have the tradeskill to create an item (or if it isn't high enough), the marketeer will find someone who does and the item will be added to your queue.

**5\. Post a job for the item.**

If you don't have the materials to make an item, you can post a job using the Character > Jobs menu.  In this job, you can specify the item and level you want, and offer whatever price you feel is fair.  The job can then be completed by anyone, and you will be notified when the job is complete.  If you need the item quickly, it is recommended to increase your offer, as players will rush to complete jobs that offer good payment. 

**6\. Request the item in the marketplace channel.**

As a last resort, you can make a post in the marketplace channel to indicate you are buying an item.  You can access the channel by typing "/market" in the chat box.  Text in this channel is reset nightly, and on days of high activity, the text may scroll out of the viewable window.  This channel is the only method that provides you the ability to negotiate a price with the seller.  Begging for items is highly discouraged, so make sure to offer payment for the items you request.
