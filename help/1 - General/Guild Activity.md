The Guilds screen now includes a section showing the total number of members in the guild and the average activity of the guild members.

For larger guilds this activity reading may not be so accurate, but for smaller guilds it should be a clear indicater of the status of the guild.

Activity is calculated based on the days since guild members played (added together) divided by the total number of people in the guild.

It is then displayed as follows:

*   Very Active (2 days or less)
*   Active (14 days or less)
*   Semi Active (60 days or less)
*   Inactive (160 days or less)
*   Comatose (longer than 160)

For example:

Guild A has 5 members, Bob was last on 5 days ago, Fried was on 3 days ago, Sam was on 60 days ago and Boff and Bill were on 1 day ago. The activity of this guild would be (5 + 3 + 60 + 1 + 1) = 70, 70 / 5 = 14. Based on this example the official rating would be "Active" (but only just) .

This is intended as a guideline only and not a true indicator.
