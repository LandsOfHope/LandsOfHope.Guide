The following colors are now used to highlight damage from spells in combat.

*   **ACID**
*   **AIR**
*   **COLD**
*   **DISEASE**
*   **DRUID**
*   **EARTH**
*   **ENERGY**
*   **FIRE**
*   **HELL**
*   **ICE**
*   **LUMINARY**
*   **POISON**
*   **WATER**

If spell damage shows no obvious color difference, that means the spell has no magic type.
