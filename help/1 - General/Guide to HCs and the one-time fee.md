Lands of Hope is free to play for the first 100 levels.  If you want to go beyond 100 levels, there is a small one-time fee required.  That fee is paid using Hope Credits (HCs).  The one-time fee is 3HCs. 

There are several ways to acquire HCs:  
  
\- The simplest is paying for them: $5 = 1HC.  This is the preferred method to acquire HCs, as it supports the developer of the game, who in-turn, continues to provide the players with new and exciting content.  You can buy HCs by clicking on the Hope Credits link after logging in to the website, but before logging into the game.  
  
\- You can also find people in-game willing to sell HCs for in-game money.  The price of HCs ranges anywhere from 10pp to over 100pp, depending on supply and demand (pp is the pink currency, 1pp = 1,000,000bp).  Refer to the HC Marketplace (on the File menu in-game) to see if people are selling and how much people are paying.  
  
\- If you refer 4 people to the game, and all of them pay the one-time fee, then your account is rewarded with 3HCs.  
  
_\- Each month, the account who provided the most referrals (paid or not) is awarded 3HCs.  You can check the current rankings by clicking on Referral Rankings after logging in to the website, but before logging into the game. - **No more HCs for top referrals as of April 2010**_  
  
\- Occasionally, contests are held in-game, like building contests.  Winners of these contests can win HCs.  These contests are advertised in the daily announcements and on the website when they occur.  
  
  
Even after paying the one-time fee, HCs can be used for a variety of things: expansion packs, amazing items, character enhancements, and more.  Look at File > Buy Extras to see what other things HCs can be used for.
