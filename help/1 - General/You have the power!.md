As a player of Lands of Hope you hold the destiny of the game in your hands, I can only do so much with regards posting our site links and information on various sites but you guys really have the power to make the game more than it is by getting new people to play above and beyond what I can do.

I have listed the game on a number of sites, some of which are no longer actively updated so it becomes quite difficult to make news posts for those sites, so I am always on the look out for new places to submit the game to.

**How can I help?**  
I am sure you all visit other sites, sites that are either related to gaming or social networking and these sites allow you to post in forums, consider making a post about the game on the forums and say why you like it.

Also if you know of some web sites that list similar games such as RWK, Runescape, AdventureQuest or Lunatix Online that we are not listed on you can try to submit our link [http://www.forlornonline.com](http://www.forlornonline.com) to those sites (or contact support to have them look into submission).

You can also refer people to the game and earn rewards for doing so, I am sure you all must have online friends and if you havent already done so getting them to play is a great way of helping us out!

Finally voting for us on the voting sites we are listed on is another great way to increase our traffic, the three main sites we are listed on are available for voting via graphical buttons inside the chat system every 30 or so minutes (yes those 3 boxes in the middle of chat).

**The Holy Grail of Advertising  
**Somehow last year we got a mention in Game Informer magazine, this magazine did a special article on browser games (as it is usually a graphical game magazine) we got a mention that pretty much doubled the amount of signups we had for 4 months .... this seems to be a good way to get more visitors.

Getting us in a magazine is no easy feat, if any of you read gaming magazines or related magazines consider writing an email/letter to the editor or relevant contact to let them know about Lands of Hope and why YOU think it is a game worthy of them mentioning!
