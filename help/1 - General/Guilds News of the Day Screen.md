The ews of the day screen can be used to set daily messages to be sent to people in your guild. It is a great way to enter a reminder or announcement that should hopefully stir your guild members into action.

The message you set will appear at the bottom of the screen in the status window the first time a guild members logs in that day. _The message is sent as part of the daily maintenance cycle which means 12:05am each day._
