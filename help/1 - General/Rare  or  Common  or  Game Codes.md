These items have recently started dropping in the lands, or can be gained from quests ...

These codes can be entered into a screen in the Forlorn Card Game, once the code is used it is gone for good so be careful who you share your codes with as someone could quite easily steal your code and run off with it!

**Common Codes / Game Codes**  
These are the most basic form of codes and drop frequently, when redeeming this code you have a chance of gaining a card point ... and a chance of gaining nothing.

**Rare Codes  
**Obtainable from special quests and other events these have the name "Rare code" instead of saying common or game code and generally give a special card when redeemed.
