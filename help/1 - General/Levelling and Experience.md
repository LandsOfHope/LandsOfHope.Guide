The game uses a fairly standard experience system which sees you gain experience for doing almost everything in the game from crafting to fighting to gathering.

To level up you have to gain a set amount of experience once you have met or passed the experience needed to level up you will gain a level and the experience used to make the level is deducted from your current total (effectively putting you back to 0 again). As you level up the experience required to get the next level increases but you will also notice the amount of experience you gain from performing actions increases.

When you level up you gain various stats depending on your class and your skill max limit goes up by 5pts.

**Skill Max Formula**  
Skill Max = Level \* 5

_i.e. At level 10 your skill max is 50_

You can not raise any skill past your skill max, but you can use items to get past your max.

**Additional Information**  
Your experience is displayed in the top left corner of the game window just below your level so you will have a visual indicator of how far you have to go to level up at all times.

If you can not see your experience bar below your level it is likely due to one of these reasons:

*   You are level 100 and on a free account, as you can not level to level 101 until you pay for the game there is no point in your seeing the experience bar so it is hidden for your convenience. You can still see how much experience you have by visiting the Character > Info screen.
*   You are level 1000.1000, if you have become one of the few to reach the lofty heights of level 1000.1000 you will notice the experience bar is hidden ... this is simply because there is no reason to display it as you can not gain any more levels due to you being at the level cap.
