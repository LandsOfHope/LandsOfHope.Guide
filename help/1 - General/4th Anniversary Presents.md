**Fourth Anniversary Box  
**The fourth anniversary box pets have now been confirmed and here is the artwork.

**Muffie**  
A demonic cross between a cookie and a muffin. You never know which side is dominant and the internal struggle may very well rip the muffie asunder. _(Not Mountable)_

This pet will come as the Ancient Cook class, a special caster class that gets the rare Cooking Magic spell line.

**Cookie Buzzard**  
Next time you visit a fast food restaurant ask them for some Cookie fried buzzard wings, they are really nice. Unfortunately one of the cookie buzzards escaped into the wild and successfully mated. _(Not Mountable)_

This pet will come as the Ancient Scavenger class, with slightly better stats than a nobleman.

**Cookie Cat**  
One day when Decius was experimenting with his Little Mr GM Cooking set his pet cat accidentally fell into a bowl of magical cookie dough and ended up getting baked. The curious result of this accident is the Cookie Cat. A mountable pet with exquisitely refined taste \*yum yum\*.
