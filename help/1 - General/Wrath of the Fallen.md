Once a day between Noon and Midnight (starting tomorrow) there will be a random event, one lucky player who has 5000 or moreÂ kills in any race will be chosen and the race of monsters he/she killed will gang up and decide to reap their revenge upon thee!

A dungeon will spawn packed with harder versions of that race and a boss to kill, it is a relatively small dungeon and the boss will drop a trophy item that is obviously ultra rare as it will potentially only be available once a day.

Most of you will notice the Noon to Midnight time range above, this is simply due to the fact that this window will give more people a chance to take part, compared to the floating palace there are not normally very many people with 5,000 or more kills on during the morning so an afternoon window will potentially ensure that more people are available for it.

As with the floating palace only the person the dungeon spawns for will be able to complete it, unlike the floating palace this dungeon will spawn for anyone with 5k or more kills BUT it will be located in Knotwood Valley and not the realm you were in when you got the message.

**Trophy Reward**  
Take the cold dish to 33, 58 KV and give it to Tee P Kaka for a 55 slot +stealth bag.
