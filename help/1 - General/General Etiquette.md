The following are guidelines that if everyone followed would make for a more enjoyable experience for all.

*   After killing a monster destroy the corpse, if you do not destroy the corpse it will linger on the tile for a few minutes and prevent new monsters from spawning. This means people entering the tile behind you will get annoyed that you are not clearing your kills. You can destroy the corpse in any of the following ways:
    *   Skin, use the skinning skill to remove the monsters hide.
    *   Soul Trap, shaman ability to capture the soul of a fallen monster.
    *   Intercede, priest ability.
    *   Destroy Corpse button (available to all and at the bottom of the loot screen).
*   If you go to a tile and see pets or players on that tile you should consider moving to another tile, it is likely the person on that tile is either gathering resources on that tile or killing the monsters, as two people can not fight the same monster and both get rewards for it one of you will end up getting frustrated. There are 10,000 tiles in each realm and usually more than enough monster spawns to cover all the quests, so moving should not be that much of an ordeal.
*   Appraising, most people assume that if someone is standing on Springlade tile with an inventory full of unidentified items that they wish to have their items appraised. This may not always be the case so it is polite to ask someone before you appraise their items ...
*   Begging, do not beg from people in chat. There is a skill in the game called Begging but that does not use chat, it does not harm anyone either ... begging is a form of spam and should not be used.
*   Be nice to people, and they in turn should be nice to you ... if someone isnt nice to you but you are nice to them the whole time they are in the wrong and will surely get bad cookies for christmas!
