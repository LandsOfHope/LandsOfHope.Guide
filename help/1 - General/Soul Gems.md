Shamans using Spirit Magic have the ability to trap souls of monsters they killed in battle, these trapped souls are placed into empty soul gems the Shaman must have in his inventory prior to starting combat.

When you kill a monster and use the Loot screen there will be an option to trap the soul, once the button is clicked the corpse will be destroyed so make sure you have looted the corpse prior to clicking the button.

These Soul Gems can then be used in several different ways.

*   You can install the Soul Gem into a room, creating a monster spawn in that room. To do this you need a Spawn Room (these are special rooms but the entrance room of a building acts as one too). Use the Spawn button on the lower bar when standing inside your room to start this process.
*   You can also transmigrate the soul gem, this releases the dead spirit and creates a monster. So you can transmigrate a Cow and a Cow monster will spawn. To do this goto your Inventory screen and use the Soul Gem via the Use button.
*   You can now also use Soul Gems in combat as if it was an item of food, this will have the effect of regenerating your mana for several rounds. This change only applies to soul gems made after January 7th 2008.
    *   Lesser soul gems, these can be gained from monsters under level 600.
    *   Greater soul gems, these can be gained from monsters of level 600 or higher and provide enhanced effects when used in combat.

New Soul Gems can be summoned using a Spirit Magic spell called Soul Gem Creation which requires SPIRIT MAGIC: 283. This spell can be gained from Coldglen town.
