Alright so perhaps you are out of work right now, or have no income to spare which is understandable with the current economic situation.

Or perhaps for that matter you think the game isnt worth spending money on, which begs the question why are you here playing it!

If you want Lands of Hope to survive and flourish once more then the simple thing you need to do is to start being proud, be proud you play this great game, be proud of all the friends you have made here and be proud that Decius is so darn speshul!

Now what do proud people do?

Good question they go tell everyone they know how amazingly cool this game is, they sing it from the roof tops!

But if you don\`t have a roof top or are worried about safety issues the easier alternative is to tell your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Myspace etc ... about the game and an even better idea is to make posts on sites you visit frequently that have forums or places to review games.

Write about the game, you don\`t even have to be gud at engrish, just write from the heart ... talk about the game tell people why you enjoy it and post a link back to the site etc ...

There are over 200 active daily players here each day, don\`t assume that someone else will do these things go and do them yourself.

After all whats to stop everyone else from assuming someone else will put in the effort and then no one will!

If you love Lands of Hope prove IT!.
