A Money deed is like a money order, you can visit any post NPC such as the one inside Springlade town building, then click on them and click the Money deed button to access the screen for making a money deed.

You basically turn all or just a part of your money into a deed, this is essentially an item which means it can be posted or stored in a vault or chest or simply given away.

After making a money deed you can claim the money simply by using the deed from your inventory, it will immediately deposit the money back in your held funds or you can sell it as you would sell an item to get its entire value.

There is no fee or cost involved in making or claiming a money deed.
