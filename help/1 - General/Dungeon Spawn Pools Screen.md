The dungeon spawn pools screen is used to configure pools. A pool is a list of races that can then be applied to a room instead of having one specific race spawn.

It can be kind of interesting to have multiple races spawn in a dungeon room as it makes the dungeon more diverse.

Use the configure screen to select and then add new races to the pool or to select and then remove races that are currently on the pool list.

When you are done use the Back button to go back to the previous screen.

_You can use the Pool button at the bottom of the main spawn screen to switch to pool mode to set a room to use your pool list._
