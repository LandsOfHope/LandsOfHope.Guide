With the new interface in place it is now possible to Move and Resize many of the game elements.

You must activate Resize mode to do this, either use Alt + R or click the Cog icon in the top right corner ![](game/icons/cog.png)Â of the game window and choose Toggle Resize .

Click on the Window you wish to move, a series of 8 white boxes will appear around it to indicate it is sizeable.

You can then click and drag the window to a new position or use these sizing boxes to resize the window to a new size.

Note: When you are done click off the window so nothing has the boxes around it, then press Alt + R or go to the cog and choose Toggle Resize.

This will turn off Resize mode and ensure there are no accidental window movings/resizings!
