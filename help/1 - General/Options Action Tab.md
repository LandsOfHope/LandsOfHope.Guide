*   **Talk**, Talk to the target.
*   **VIew**, View the targets Inventory (useful for thieves who are working on stealing).
*   **Tame**, Tame the target (useful for people with taming skill who are working on raising it).
*   **Care**, Cares for the target (useful for people raising the husbandry skill).
*   **Default**, Change back to the default method of interaction.

*   **Default**, Change back to the default method of interaction.
