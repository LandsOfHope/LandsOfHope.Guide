The Manage Town screen can be accessed by clicking the Town button at the bottom of the screen when standing on a tile you own.

The Manage Town screen can be used to manage all of the tiles you have permissions to manage in the current realm however by default the current tile you are on is selected.

To manage a different tile use the white arrow buttons to move the displayed view around then click on the tile in the map window on the left of the screen to select it.

Tiles you own will be marked with a bouncing arrow symbol so you can easily see tiles you currently already own incase you don\`t remember the locations.

You can use the Action Mode toggle in the center of the screen to switch between management tasks.

**Edit Mode**

Using edit mode you can change the following tile properties:

*   **Name**, allows you to change the name of the tile.
*   **Description**, allows you to provide/change the tile description. This is the block of text that is sent to a visitors status window when they enter your tile.
*   **Tile for Sale**, allows you to make this tile show up on the Land > Buy Land screen. _Please only tick this box after setting the sale price as you don\`t want to accidentally sell your tile for nothing._
*   **Sale Price**, allows you to set the price you wish to sell your land tile for. Typical prices are 5pp or higher for the first realm raising in 5pp increments each subsequent realm. The price box is used in conjunction with the Tile for sale check box. 
*   **Permit**, with this box checked players will need a special permit to construct a building on your tile. These permits can be made using the Town action mode feature. Very useful feature if you wish to only allow select people to build on your tile.
*   **Enemies**, with this box checked monsters will spawn on this tile and without the box checked no monster will spawn here.

Click the Save button to confirm your changes.

**Town Mode**

![](http://www.forlornonline.com/images/landtown.jpg)  
Using town mode you can perform the following actions:

*   **Make Permit**, creates a single construction permit. A permit is required by anyone who tries to build on a tile that has the Permit box ticked (Edit action mode). You can therefore make multiple permits and give them to people you wish to allow to own property on your tile.
*   **Make Relocation Permit**, these are special permits that players can use from their inventory. They allow you to move a building you have on another tile to the tile the relocation permit was made for.
*   **Make Quest Building**, creates a special building. These types of buildings have limited options at the moment.
*   **Mapped Tile**, allows you to make this tile a mapped tile. This enables the tile to show up on the World > Maps screen and other places. You may only own one mapped tile per realm so you need to consider wisely which tile you own deserves to be the mapped tile.

**Delete Mode**  
Used to delete the selected land tile. This will reset the tile back to defaults but leave any buildings or tile items you added behind. This tile will cease to be owned by anyone and may revert back to being up for sale on the Land > Buy Land screen.
