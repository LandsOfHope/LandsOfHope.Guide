Added in 2010 the Anniversary token is a loot drop from monsters both inside and outside of dungeons.

This token has a 1 in 3 chance of dropping and will only drop during the month of July.

Once you have 1000 tokens, go to 32 62 KV, enter the Market of Dreams and find the NPC that will exchange them for an Armored Sloth.
