Many players ask this question when they reach the level 20-30 range after trying to enter the cold regions. This guide is aimed at those players and will explain the more common ways of getting the Cold Survival you crave.

There are many ways to achieve your goals in this game, and getting Cold Survival is no different. Cold Survival is not a skill that can be learned - it is most easily available through item bonuses, potions and having a mountable pet with the Cold Survival mount bonus. This guide will describe some of the common ways to get this skill; it is not an exhaustive list, as there are other ways and means, but will concentrate on those that are of most use to lower level players.

(1) Potions: There is a Quest available from Harlow the Healer at Coldglen Border where you need to find a Cyan Crystal to redeem for two potions which give you Cold Survival for 24 hours each. To find the crystals, you need to go to a desert tile where crystals spawn at random - this can take an unpredictable length of time.

Cyan Crystals are sometimes offered for sale at the Marketeer, or you can have them crafted for you using the "craft" option at the Marketeer. For this, you will need an Aqua and Silver crystal and a mortar and pestle.

Aside from this potion, you may be able to buy Firebelly Brandy at the Marketeer or have it crafted for you like the Crystal. For this, you will need grain\*6, milk\*2 and a bowl. This will protect you for 30 minutes and you need to be level 45 to use it.

(2) Rings are the most common items with Cold Survival bonus. Rings are drops from salamander and pixie kills. These will protect you while-ever they are equipped. The lowest level ring however, is level 85.

(3) Pets can give you Cold Survival skill when mounted. Snow Monsters are the most commonly ones available at the Marketeer - they aren\`t often available to buy though, and tend to be at a higher level when they are for sale.

Happy hunting in the cold regions; and don\`t forget your winter woollens.
