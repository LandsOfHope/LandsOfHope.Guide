To create a new accout you must first accept the LoH/Forlorn Games Terms of Service document which can be found at the following location:

[http://www.forlornonline.com/fhtos.asp](http://www.forlornonline.com/fhtos.asp)  
  
After reading the TOS there will be a button to ACCEPT the Terms, this will then take you to the new account screen.

You should fill in all of the boxes on the account screen:

*   **Account Name**, Your account name is also the username you use to log into the game try to use a unique name or something that no one knows you under to maximise security.
*   **Referrer**, If someone referred you to the game they would have given you a numeric value this is their unique account referrer id and is something that you should enter here for that person to gain you as a referral.
*   **Password**, Please use a good password one that is a mixture of characters and numbers and not something someone can easily guess.
*   **Email Address**, A valid email address for account verification purposes.
*   _How did you find us_, We are listed on a number of sites so it is always useful to find out how someone heard about us.

After entering the details in the new account screen click the Signup button to have your account created and a verification email sent to your email address.  
  
_All of these details can be changed after making the account but remember the Email Address is vitally important as we need to verify that address before you can play._  
  
If you do not receive a verification email to that address it is most likely due to the fact that you entered an incorrect email address, the email was deleted due to junk filters or there was some problem sending the email. If you have email filtering or blocking enabled you should add @forlornonline.com and @fho2.com to your list of trusted domains/email senders so that our emails can reach you.  
  
Once your account is verified you can make new characters and begin to play Lands of Hope!
