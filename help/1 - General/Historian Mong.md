Historian Mong at 53, 41 in the Royal Hollow realm offers allegiance specific game rewards ... he has gathered ancient allegiance relics but will only hand them over to someone in that allegiance who gives him a relic in trade.

To get a relic you must complete one of the following level 990 dungeons in Royal Hollow.

*   Exile Dungeon - Tombs of the Kings at 14, 47 Royal Hollow
*   Society Dungeon - Royal Excavations at 32, 41 Royal Hollow
*   Reaper Dungeon - Dark Hollow Mountain at 5, 46 Royal Hollow

All three dungeons are locked, you must speak to an NPC inside your allegiance base in that realm to get the key.

**Key Locations**

*   Tombs of the Kings Key located at 95, 67 inside Caves of Rebellion (speak to NPC).
*   Royal Excavations Key located at 74, 55 inside Ramirez Estate (speak to NPC).
*   Dark Hollow Mountain Key located at 92, 11 inside Death Valley (speak to NPC).

The key keepers will not just give you the key as that would be too easy muhaha!

The rewards that Historian Mong offers are directly related to your allegiance symbol.
