There is now a new drop only Artisan crafting planÂ  for 5000 Artisan skill called "Crafters Measure" it allows you to make a Trophy item called the same, requiring 10 planks and 10 cut gems.

There is an NPC inside Historian Elwicks house in the Royal Hollow who will take said Crafters Measure and will need approximately 200 crafters measures in return the NPC will give you a piece of the Makers set of clothing.

There are a total of five pieces that make up this set, completing a full set and equipping it will allow you to activate a +20 Queue Bonus set ability, you must have this set equipped to keep this bonus on.

Both the legend armor pieces and the Crafters Measure item are no trade, no auction etc and are in no way shape or form meant to be given to other players.
