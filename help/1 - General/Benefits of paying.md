**What do I get for my One time payment?**  
Paying is now optional (as of August 2010) all free players can now reach level 1000.

Paying the one time fee, will however make your account characters safe from maintenace. All free accounts will be subject to regular character deletions for inactive accounts.

Newly added (June 08) payers also get access to special trophy quests. After paying visit the Genie Lantern at 33, 58 and speak to the NPC inside.

There are currently 4 different trophy items you can get that equip to the Bonus 1 slot, one item for people who have paid, another for people who have paid and own Jurassic Wars, and another who have paid and own Dragons of the East and a final item for people who have paid and own both Jurassic Wars and Dragons of the East.

There is also a new building in Lakeview that has more trophy quests!

Various buildings in the lands are now paid member only accessible, this includes Dungeon Mastery and many of the End Game content areas. _We reserve the right to make any building Paid only if we think it is justified._

Also paid account holders will receive a special text effect in chat that makes their name show up differently and is quite noticable.

**What does my money pay for?**  
The 15USD fee generally goes towards server costs with additional money raised from the one time fee or via the Extras system goes towards paying for advertising and artists the rest of the money if we have any left over is used to pay me, without your money I couldnt work on LoH full time and it wouldnt be the same game it is today.

Approximate Expenses (per month)

*   Server, 350USD
*   Advertising on Google and other sites, 200USD
*   Utilities/Internet, 30USD
*   Domain renewals/Misc hosting, 30USD
*   Artwork, 200 - 300USD
*   Additional expenses, 50USD

Total: 960USD

This is the absolute bottom line, if the game does not make 960USD a month it can not function ... that said it has to make a lot more than this for me to be able to spend the time I do working on it, without additional money there could be no updates asÂ I would not be able to afford to do them.
