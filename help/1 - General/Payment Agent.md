To increase the availability for people to pay for the game, especially in the case of the children or people without access to a PayPal account or Credit/Debit cards (and permission to use it) I have appointed Dragoonus as a Payment Agent.

**What does this mean?**  
It means people can mail english pounds to Dragoonus either in the form of checks/money orders or cash and he will deposit this into his bank account and it will be transferred to us and used to pay for your account or HC.

Due to exchange rates and the fact that our payment agent will be paid on a per transaction arrangement you will find that paying via this method instead of PayPal is a little more expensive but it will hopefully still be an attractive offer to many people.

The expected rates are as follows:

**One time fee**  
Basic price:Â 10GBP (this includes the addition of 1HC to your game account)  
Payment processing fee: 5GBP  
\-------------------------------------------  
Total: 15GBP

I am trying to make this as transparent as possible, if you had paid the one time fee and bought 1HC it would have cost approximately 10GBP so you can see that aside for Dragoonus's fee we are not making any extra money out of this deal.

**Buying Hope Credits**  
Dragoonus will also accept GBP for straight HC transfer the rates for this will be explained in detail on the Hope Credits screen, but as with the one time fee they will also include the 5GBP surcharge.
