There comes a point in every players life when they must make their first trip to sell goods or simply to make room in their inventory.

You can sell your goods to a number of NPCs including the Healer and General Store characters.

_To do this click on the NPC and the screen below should be shown. In some cases you may have to click a Sell Items button at the bottom of the screen to have the selling screen show up._

The sell items screen defaults to showing all items in your sell bag that can be sold. The sell bags only purpose in life is to make it easier for you to sell items by keeping the items you wish in one easy place so you do not have to worry about accidentally selling an item you wished to keep.

To sell a single item simply click on the item and then click the Sell button on the right side of the screen.

To sell multiple items at once you can use the buttons in the middle of the screen:

*   Ided, selects all identified items on this page of the bag.
*   Unided, selects all unidentified items on this page of the bag.
*   All, selects all items on this page of the bag.
*   None, deselects any selected items on this page of the bag.
*   Sell, sells the selected items on this page of the bag to the NPC.
*   Empty, every single sellable item in your sell bag is sold to the NPC.

_Selling an item will cause it to be deleted from the game forever so you should be careful when selling as there is no way to recover an item you may have sold accidentally._

Once you sell an item your held funds will go up by however much money you earned from the selling process.

**Selling from other bags**  
To sell items from inside other bags use the bag bar at the bottom of the screen and click on the bag icon you wish to sell from.
