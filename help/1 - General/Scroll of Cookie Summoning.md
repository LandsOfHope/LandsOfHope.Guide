Today I have added in a new bought extra called a "Scroll of Cookie Summoning". You can buy these as either a scroll with 5 charges or a scroll with 50 charges.

Upon using the scroll one charge is consumed and a very nasty monster called a Cookie Devourer is spawned. Older players may remember these as special monsters that spawned once or twice a day a few years ago to celebrate the games anniversary.

Upon killing the Cookie Devourer you will receive a "Cookie monster piece" trophy item. This item can be taken to a new NPC at 27, 61 in Knotwood Valley. The NPC will offer to take these pieces in exchange for some very cool items ... at the time of writing this the items available are:

*   Sweet n Sticky Cloak
*   Delicious Cookie Ring
*   Blessed Cookie Wings

These items have the best and most stats of any item in the game so far on them and are perfect no matter your class. Well with the exception of the Apprentice class unless you are just turning them in for the coolness factor!

Additional items may become available over time ....
