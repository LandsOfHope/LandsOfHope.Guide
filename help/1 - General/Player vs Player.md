Part of the new PvP system has been added. The new PvP switch to turn PvP on and off is now in, and has been made so it will work on both TG and HG before the merge completes so people on TG can now PvP other people on TG ... both people need the PvP flag turned on.

To turn PvP on for yourself so you can PvP others with it turned on type /pvp into chat, this will turn it on if it is off or turn it off if it is on (with a limitation to prevent someone turning it off immediately).

Please note with PvP turned on you will not be able to enter player owned buildings, but you will still be able to enter system dungeons, buildings and world tiles.

This is a feature designed to prevent hit and run tactics where someone PvP\`s another player then runs and hides in some locked backroom so they cant be attacked back ...

Right now you will get 1 pvp fame point and 1pvp kill point for winning a PvP encounter... this is a small part of the planned PvP system you will also lose experience and PvP points when you die.

**Limitations**  
If you attack and kill someone who is more than 100 levels lower than your character it will not give any fame, infact it will give you -2 fame. This is a deterrant to stop people player killing those who are too low level.

**Death and Destruction Days**  
Every Saturday and Tuesday of every week will see Death and Destruction Days, these are days designed to encourage PvP by offering 150% of normal experience for killing a player 2 pvp fame points per kill instead of the usual 1pt.

**PvP Ranks**  
Each rank is attained through gaining enough fame to be promoted, you are promoted automatically after getting the necessary fame from a PvP fight. Each rank unlocks a new title for you to use from the Character > Appearance Profile screen and may unlock other rewards.

You can view these rewards by going to Library > Factions and looking at the Hellscar Legion faction, to buy the rewards once you acquire enough fame go to the NPC at 94, 5 and select the reward then click the Take button.
