The Stargate is a new bought extra for 10USD. That allows you to link building and dungeon rooms together so you can create much better themed dungeons, or perhas a "Gateway" building to allow faster access to your dungeons.

The game features a system that allows one room to automatically teleport you to another room when you try to enter it, this system is what I am using to make this all possible. This means that essentially the room you choose as the Source room to teleport to another room can not be accessed so if you place chests or other furnishings inside you will not be able to get to them.

**How to link a room to another**  
Use the Stargate from your inventory when standing in your source room, this will then give you a list of buildings on the tile you can choose as the destination ... if you wish to link across realms you will need to type the name of the building into the building list and it should find it so you can select it.

Once selected you are given an overhead view of the building/dungeon so you can choose the exact room to be the destination.

The overhead view also shows rooms that currently link to another using a gold color so you can quickly see rooms you have already setup in this fashion.

To make a connection simply click on the room and then the link will be completed, please note this is purely one way. As it does not make sense to try to link two rooms back and forth because you would get stuck in a loop.

**Clearing a Wormhole**  
To clear a wormhole it is a little harder because you will not be able to enter the room once it has a wormhole in it, without being teleported.

If youÂ bring up the Stargate screen while standing in a non-wormhole room and select the building that has the wormhole in it you can then click on the gold squares where a wormhole is placed and it will clear the wormhole link.
