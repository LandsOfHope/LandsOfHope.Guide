**Debuffs in combat**  
From now on when you cast a debuff on something in combat it will only be possible to get the debuffed skill into the negatives from one cast, subsequent casts of a debuff spell while a skill is in negatives will not yield any benefits.

Example:

Bob casts Poison Weakness on Fred, Poison Weakness lowers Fred's poison resist skill from 10 to -10 points, Bob casts Poison Weakness again but as Fred's skill is already in the negatives no change is made and Bob effectively wasted a spell cast.

Example 2:

Bob casts Poison Weakness on Fred, Poison Weakness lowers Fred\`s poison resist skill from 20 to 0 points, Bob casts the spell again the next round and it lowers Fred\`s skill to -20 points, in the third round he tries again but no change is made as the skill is below 0 already.

The point to this change is to prevent a certain tactic some people have adopted that involves constantly debuffing a target for rounds on end until the target has extremely negative resistant skills, upon which casting a spell in that damage line even a really low mana spell will do an insane amount of damage. If you combine a pet and a player with debuffs and the right damage spells together it makes for an extremely deadly combination that could be easily abused.

This change does not alter the way weakness spells on Artifact weapons work, with those it will still be possible to get lower resist skills as they are random and not guaranteed to work.
