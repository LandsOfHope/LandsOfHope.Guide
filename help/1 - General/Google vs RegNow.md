The game has now been linked to Google Checkout, this should mean the phasing out of RegNow over time as it is now redundant.

RegNow was a good solution but it was something that was not really intended for the kind of service I use it for, RegNow was primarily used by software developers to sell software to people and they charge a high fee of 5USD or more per transaction, the way their fee structure works is such that on a 100USD RegNow purchase the game would only receive 84USD as profit, as you can imagine that is a large amount of money to lose out on.

Google Checkout has similar fee amounts to PayPal so we make more of a profit with each transaction over RegNow, it is also instant like PayPal and unlike Paypal you do not need to own a Google account to use it so like RegNow you can pay for things without having to make an account which is handy for people who dont like to sign up to new things to make purchases.

As Google Checkout supports the same cards as RegNow and has different verification procedures it may be easier for a lot of people who had problems with RegNow to pay for Hope credits now.
