When you engage in PvP (Player vs Player) combat there is now a system in place to prevent abuse of the PvP point system. This means that if you attack someone and win or attack someone and lose you can not fight them again for 2 - 3 minute period, and they also can not fight you for the same period.

We previously tried having a system where by if you attacked someone and won you could not attack them for 5 minutes, while they could attack you .... however it seems that some people may have abused this by dying deliberately to whoever attacked them.

The idea with this new system is to try to prevent a player from picking on one specific target, but also to try to keep PvP fun for all those involved.
