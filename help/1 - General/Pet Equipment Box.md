The Pet Equipment Box can be used to spawn a set of 11 items for your pet to equip, it spawns items at your pets level and based on your pets requirements as entered by yourself when using the box itself, the box has unlimited charges! - As this box provides quite a nice boost to pets the cost has been set at 15USD (3HC) in theory if you have a level 1000 player you can buy it for that player then trade the pets you wish to have equipment upgraded to that player and perform the upgrade and trade the pet back or you can use a Carrier Pidgeon to send the box around your characters upgrading the pets as needed.  
  
**Instructions for use**  
After buying the Item take it out of your trade bag and then use it from your Inventory screen. It will present you with a list of your pets and let you pick one of them (you can use the item over and over again so do not worry about the item being used up as it will never happen).

After selecting the pet you will have a number of buttons to choose from these correspond to the bonuses the items will come with, you can either choose the random button or select one of the available options to sway the system in that bonuses favor. Please note that selecting a bonus will alter the stats of at least 6 items but several of the remaining items have fixed stats not affected by the buttons.

**The box will then spawn the 11 items in the selected pets inventory at the level of the pet and you can equip them via the Minions > ManageÂ  screen Equip button.**

**Finally  
**While many may see this as giving a massive advantage to people with money the box does not offer any true advantage, it provides items that can not be gained anywhere else but items with similar stats or better can be acquired already if you are prepared to hunt for them without buying the box, it merely provides a faster way to access such things and as such is not game breaking.

**And Finallly Part II**  
This item does not work on Summoned pets as they are often times not meant to come with gear as they are meant to be disposable and either come with all they are meant to work with initially or have higher stats/skills than normal to compensate.
