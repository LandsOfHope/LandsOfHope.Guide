The Myzan Lottery is a new feature, you can go to 31, 58 and buy a lottery ticket from the NPC that sells them there, buying a lottery ticket costs 1gp per ticket ...

You can buy as many tickets as you want, however blank tickets do not increase the lotto pot, only once you use the ticket and choose your 3 numbers will the lottery pot be increased and your new blank ticket bound to that weeks lottery.

In this way you can buy a lot of tickets in one go, and keep them in storage and only use them when you feel like it, tickets are not deleted by the system it is up to you to delete a losing ticket.

Every sunday during maintenance, the lottery draw will be held and 3 random numbers chosen. There will be an announcement sent to the Status Window letting everyone know what the numbers were and any other relevant information ... the prize is not given out automatically like a real lottery you have to take your ticket to the second NPC inside the Lotto Building who will verify your ticket and make sure it contains the genuine Cookie stamp of authenticity. If it does you will either win the entire prize if you were the only person to buy a ticket with that number or a share of the prize based on the number of people winning.

Prizes can be claimed indefinately after a lottery, so you dont have to worry about claiming the prize right away you can do it weeks, or even months after as long as you hold the ticket.

If the prize is not wonÂ the jackpot will roll over to the next week and keep doing so until someone(s) wins.

Good Luck!
