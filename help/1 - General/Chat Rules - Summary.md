You should have read our chat rules before chatting in the game, it is assumed that you have read and accepted them when you tick the TOS Acceptance box to make a character.

The rules can be found at the following link: [http://www.forlornonline.com/chatrules.asp](http://www.forlornonline.com/chatrules.asp)[](http://www.forlornonline.com/chatrules.asp)

if your channel is private it is up to you to police it, a moderator or GM will only step in if their are things going on in violation of the TOS (not chat rules).

If your channel is public, you are urged to keep to the standard Chat Rules at all times as well as keeping to the TOS.
