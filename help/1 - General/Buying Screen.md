There are many NPCs in the game that can sell you goods and items such as Healers and more commonly the General Store NPC.

_When you click on a shop type NPC it should show the screen below, in some cases such as the Healer a different screen is shown first requiring you to click the Buy Items button at the bottom of the screen to show the screen that lets you Buy Items._

The buying screen displays a list of all of the items that particular NPC can sell you, the list is grouped so that similar items like one handed weapons are in one convenient location.

You may notice that some NPCs have several pages worth of goods so you may have to click the page buttons at the top of the screen to switch between the different pages to find an item you are looking for.

You can expand or contract a grouped list of items by clicking on the header category i.e. One handed weapons.

To find out more information on an item an NPC is selling click on it then click the Info button.

Make sure you can use an item before buying it. The game will let you buy any item for sale on an NPC as long as you have enough money but that doesnt mean you can actually use the item. Check the following before buying (use the Info button):

*   **Level requirement**, If the item has a level requirement listed you can buy the item but not use it until you are that level.
*   **Armor type**, If the item is a piece of armor your class must be able to use that type of armor to be able to equip it.
*   **Skill requirement**, if the item has a skill requirement listed make sure you have that skill (must know it naturally and not from bonuses).

To purchase an item click on it then click the Buy button on the right side of the screen. If you have enough money and enough room in your inventory the item will be purchased and added to your Inventory > Containers > **Trade Bag**.

_You will need to remove the item from your Trade Bag to use it._
