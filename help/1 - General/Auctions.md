Players without the time and energy to setup a shop or with special items that are best sold in a more traditional bidding environment can make auctions.

An auction is a way for a player to list an item, and to allow multiple players to bid on the item with the highest bidder winning the item as such it is best used with more valuable items and not for everyday junk as I doubt very much people will go crazy trying to outbid each other on a Balsa staff, you should remember this when trying to make auctions.

**How to make an auction?**  
To make an auction simply go to Inventory > Auctions > Add Auction, the screen will allow you to choose the item you wish to auction out of your inventory ... if an item does not show up it means it can not be auctioned (some rarer items or bought extras are not auctionable).

After choosing the item you can set 3 basic pieces of information:

*   Starting price, this is how much the bids should start at.
*   Bid increment, this is how much money there needs to be between bids and prevents 1bp bidding wars from going on. I.e. if someone bids 5gp and your bid increment is 1gp the next bid will have to be 6gp or higher.
*   Quick sale price, this is how much money you will let the item go for if someone wishes to forgo bidding and get the item right away. Generally the Quick sale price is many times higher than the starting price and close to how much money you really want for the item.

Once you are happy with the basic information click Add Auction, you can then go to a second screen with optional information which allows you to change the following:

*   Auction name, usually defaults to the name of the item but you can change it if you wish.
    
*   Auction teaser, this short one line shows up on the auction browsing screens,
    
*   Auction description, a longer description that shows up only when someone is viewing the auction,
    
*   End date, this is the date/time the auction will end and can be adjusted for a slower or faster auction, 
    
*   All three values from the previous screen.
    

Note: Players who have the Auctioneers Cudgel bought extra can use this to set additional information and even to add a color to the auction listing. It also increases the amount of auctions you can have bye 20 items per cudgel the default amount of allowed auctions per character is 10.

**Auction Process**  
After making an auction a player can bid on your item by finding it via the Inventory > Auctions > All Auctions screen, if you entered a quick price there will also be the option for the player to buy the item outright in which case you will get a message and the money right away and the player will get the item ... normally however auctions go to bids and when the auction ends the game will automatically give the item to the winning bidder while giving you the money.

**Managing or Deleting an Auction**  
To manage/edit an auction go to Inventory > Auctions > Edit Auction.
