The referral system has now been totally redesigned, for each player you refer to Lands of Hope you will earn 1 referral point, and each player you refer that pays will get you **1 golden referral point**.

These points can then be used to redeem the following account rewards:

1.  **4 gold points** = 3HC, enough for paid status.
2.  5 referral points = 1 character slot

Also the following character rewards can be gained by visiting the NPC at 32, 58 Knotwood Valley:

1.  1 referral point = 20 healing potions or 20 magic potions, with a sell value of close to 70sp.
2.  3 referral points = 5gp
3.  4 referral points = 1 Harpy egg, which can be used to spawn a pet harpy.

This system should be more flexible than the last system, and the rewards are a lot nicer, as you can now get a good chunk of money for referring someone by claiming one of these rewards the 20sp random bonus achieved on previous referrals has been removed.

All in all I think this should make referring people to LoH a lot more appealing ...

**I should also remind you that if anyone tries to fake referrals to earn these rewards you run the risk of getting your account banned, after all the idea to referring is to get new people to Lands of Hope and not line your pockets!**
