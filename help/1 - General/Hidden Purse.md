Youmay have heard mention of the "hidden purse" it is a special amount of money that is logged against your character that you can not gain access to yourself.

The purpose of the hidden purse is for you to accumulate money that others can access through begging and stealing, in that way you do not lose anything directly as you can not use your own hidden purse and the people who beg or steal from you have access to an amount of money directly proportional to the amount of money you have spent.

**Diminishing Hidden Purse**  
Every night at midnight your hidden purse is reduced to one fifth of its original value this means that you can not accumulate a massive amount of money over a short or even long period of time and it means only the very recently active people have the best hidden purses.

**Raising the Hidden Purse**  
Buying items from an NPC will lower your Hidden Purse, while Selling Items (any NPC that buys them), or Pets (Stablemaster) to an NPC will increase it.

Note: 10% of the value of a sale goes into hidden purse, while 10% of the value of an expense comes out of the hidden purse.

This means if you spend 10gp on something your hidden purse will go down 1gp, if you sell 20gp of items your hidden purse will go up 2gp.

The following actions do NOT increase/decrease the hidden purse:

*   Marketeer selling/buying
*   Tile selling/purchasing
*   Auctions
*   Trading
*   Jobs
