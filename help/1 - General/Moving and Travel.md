There are many different ways to travel around the world of Myzan the most commonly used are explained below.

**Mini-map clicking**  
To get to a location or room that is close to where you are simply click on it on the mini-map on the left of the screen. This is the most common way to move and the chances are by the time you are reading this you will have already moved using this way.

**The following methods of travel are available only after leaving the estate and can not be used before then.**

**Coordinates**  
Coordinate travel is available once you have left the estate and at all times you are outside of buildings. Each location in a realm has a coordinate location and you simply type these coordinates into the x and y boxes below the mini-map to travel to that location.

**Recall**  
You can mark different locations in the game, this indicates that a location is important to you. From then on when you are using World > Map screen or the World > Travel screen your marked location will show up as a marker. You can then easily travel to that marked location ... it can get even easier if you use the World > Travel screen to turn on your marked location for use in the Travel Extra bar as then you simply click on the location in the extra bar and instantly travel to it.

**Map clicking**  
Some of the map screens in the game such as the World > Maps screen allow you to click on any part of the displayed map to instantly travel to that square. This is pretty handy for traversing large distances or exploring.

**Portals**  
Portalstones can be made with the portal mastery _(caster class)_ skill while anyone can use a portalstone. Using a portalstone or opening a portal using the World > Open Portal screen will then allow you and anyone that visits the location you are on a quick way to access the portals destination for up to 5 minutes.

**Keys**  
You may collect a number of building keys as you play. Keys unlock doors and rooms and they can also be used via the Inventory > Containers > Keys screen as a means to travel to the location the key is useful for so they can act as a pretty handy way of travelling.

**Maps**  
You gain treasure maps from monster loot and sometimes from random item drops on water tiles. These maps can be used via the Inventory > Containers > Maps screen and when used you can travel to the treasures location.
