Updated due to recent screen changes. 

1.   Log into the character you wish to have receive the goods. For more convenient trading I recommend moving to a tile out in the sticks, remember the coordinates if you do move.
2.  Go to File > Change Character, select the character with the items to trade and click the Login button (clicking Logout and Login will cause your current character to logout and the following step will not work) .
3.  Travel to the same location you remembered from Step 1 and you should see your character you wish to trade to sitting there. If you do not check the following:
    *   Check that the character you wish to trade to is not stealthed, if it is you will need to remove it.
    *   Check that you didnt accidentally logout or left your computer for 10 - 15minutes by which time the character would have automatically logged out. Log back into the first character and repeat the process from Step 1.
4.  Mouse over the character you wish to trade to and click the Trade button in the middle of the screen.
