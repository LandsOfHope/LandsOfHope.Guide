You can now mark two chat channels as your favourite chat channels, this makes switching to them easier as you can click the red or blue flag button in the chat bar to switch to the channel quickly.

To make a channel your favourite use /join or the room list to enter that channel then type:

**/mark 1**

or

**/mark 2**

Once marked clicking the flag buttons will move you to that channel.

Note: The mark commands use the channel number which is not unique and may change as people add/remove channels so sometimes you may find the flag buttons point to the wrong channel, if this is the case you need to mark the channel again.
