The Guilds of Hope is located 1 tile above the town of Springlade. Everyone needs to get thier Guild colors once they are in the guild. If they haven\`t been quested for yet, please quest for them and then follow these instructions. 1:Get the guild colors from the guild rewarder. 2:locate them in your inventory and click "USE" on the right side where the item\`s info is shown. You only have to do this "ONCE" --this will then tell you that you are now showing your guild colors. 3:You must then equip them for them to give you the bonuses they carry. 4:Since this is a level based item, as all guild gear is.. you must replace them about every 10 levels. In the lower levels they will not change, but once you reach lv 50, be SURE to replace them to get the most from them. Later on if you prefer to use one of the guild colors gained from doing trophy quests, you may drop the normal colors and equip one, they are called Standards, and they have different buffs depending on which one you get. You do not have to "use" those, just equip them.
