Some tutorials can not be linked to, they can only be triggered by the person clicking the ![](https://lohcdn.com/game/icons/information.png)Â button at the bottom of the screen when within a specific screen. This includes the Fight and Loot screens .... however a number of tutorials can be linked to by players in general.

To bring up the list of General Tutorials click on the ![](https://lohcdn.com/game/icons/information.png) button in the Status Window, from here you can either click the Show button to view the tutorial or click the Link button to share it with someone else.
