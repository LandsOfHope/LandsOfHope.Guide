The new color picker accessible via the Wand of Alteration can store several colors using cookies. To do this click on a color then click the take button and it will be stored in that cookie slot.

You can then simply click on the cookie color to pull that color back up.

It is worth noting however that cookies are stored on your computer and not the server, when you delete your cookies you will lose this information and also the cookies will expire after a certain amount of time so you should not depend on the colors remaining on this screen indefinately.
