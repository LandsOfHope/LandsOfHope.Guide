However there are certain buildings and features that paying for the game will grant you access to.

You can pay for the game using PayPal\*, Google Checkout\* or via traditional mail/post by sending a check, money order or cash to our US postal address or to our payment agent in the UK (slightly different fees).

To view all of the payment choices please go to your account screen, click on the Billing link and then choose your payment method/choice to find out more information.
