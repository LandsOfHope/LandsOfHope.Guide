Ok, what this means is, you rested, and were blessed with the experience bonus, it adds +33 to each experience earning action you do, for a period of 2 hours.

The same result can be achieved by drinking a greater experience potion. Level 400 requirement on those. They are crafted with Alchemy tradeskill and require 1 wolfsbane herb (spawn randomly on green tiles) and 1 empty potion bottle (crafted from 1 gem using alchemy tradeskill).
