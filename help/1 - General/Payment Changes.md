As of today a new payment system has been implemented, some may find it a little more confusing/complicated than before while others may love it!  
  
Starting today Regal Computer Services (that is my fancy name for my company) now has Merchant status, that means I can now accept Credit/Debit cards directly without going through PayPal or Google Checkout.  
  
This means you never need an account with either of those payment providers as long as you have a credit card!  
  
To simplify matters the Hope Credit purchase screen now has two buttons an Add Cart and a View Cart button, that is it ... there are no different options for PayPal or Google. If you still wish to pay using Google or PayPal you can do so by clicking the View Cart button.  
  
After purchasing your Hope Credits a code will be emailed to you that you can now enter into the new Redeem box on the Account screen. The code will then assign the HCs you purchased to your account ... this may seem one step longer than before but it also means you can give the code to someone else and they can use it to obtain the HCs you purchased which is a great way to give gifts etc ...  
  
**To celebrate this new system and for a limit of 100 purchases I am offering a 1USD off coupon on all HC purchases. To redeem this coupon type in COOKIES in the discount code box on the View Cart screen.**  
  
When using the Buy Items screen you will see that there is no longer a Buy for x$ and a Buy for xHC button, instead there is just a Purchase button which will let you use your pre-bought HCs or if you do not have enough HCs to cover the purchase provide you with options to buy more.  
  
With this new integration and merchant status I hope that some of you who were unable to use PayPal or Google can now start to make purchases.  
  
_Please note however if you do not own your own credit card and are using someone elses to pay for the game/extras PLEASE PLEASE make sure they have given you permission because fraud will lead to your account being banned/disabled and deleted._
