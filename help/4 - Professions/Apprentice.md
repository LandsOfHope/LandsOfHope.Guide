_This class is intended for experienced players or people who are fast learners it may be difficult to play for new players to the game simply because of the lack of the easy learning mode called the estate._

Allowed Armor: **None**  
The Apprentice class has no combat abilities and can not initiate combat with anything. This class is intended solely for gathering and crafting and other trade related skills, as such it starts with the following skills:

*   Foraging
*   Farming
*   Fishing
*   Geology
*   Lumberjacking
*   Mining

This class also starts with the following other skills (additional crafting skills can be bought from the relevant trainers):

*   Artisan (Special class skill)
*   Leatherworking
*   Tailoring
*   Husbandry

**Starting Out**  
If you choose this class you will automatically skip the estate as there is content on the estate that this class can not use and thus it would prevent you from completing the estate.

Instead when you start out you start inside a secure building called the Crafters Corner, it is located at 33, 58 in Knotwood Valley and contains a couple of NPCs and other useful resources that an Apprentice will need to access to unlock their full potential.

You will also start with a Crafters Chest in your inventory instead of a Strangers Chest. This chest contains a plan book with a few random plans in it for any of the crafting skills you start with as well as the standard Training box you would receive from a Strangers Chest.

To aid you in starting out the Crafters Chest contains the following:

*   Artisan tool
*   cloth \* 20
*   fishing rod
*   harvestor knife
*   hatchet
*   hide \* 20
*   hide crafting tool
*   hoe
*   pickaxe
*   thread \* 20

As you can see you get a bunch of useful gathering tools and some raw resources to help you get started.

**Class Benefits**  
The artisan skill can be used to craft a number of interesting items in particular special work clothes for your class and also belts and other items such as costumes which can be traded and sold to other players.
