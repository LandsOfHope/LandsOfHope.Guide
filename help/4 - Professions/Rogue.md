Allowed Armor: **Cloth Leather**  
The Rogue class is kind of a cross between a Fighter and an Archer, the rogue has a more restricted choice of weapons to that of a fighter as they are able to choose:

*   Daggers
*   Fists
*   Thrown Weapons

After completing the combat quest you will gain a dagger as a Rogue you can dual wield daggers so you can buy a second dagger from Monty on the estate. The Rogue class starts with the ability to use Leather as well as Cloth which puts it on an even footing with the Archer class and the Fighter class.

As well as the Rogues obvious combat skills, it gets two main non-combat skills, the STEALTH skill can be used to hide yourself from plain sight this means when you are off doing nefarious deeds no one will be able to find you unless they have TRACK HIDDEN and DETECT HIDDEN skills. Another useful skill the ROGUE class gets is LOCKPICKING which can be used to unlock locked chests in your inventory as well as any locked chest or item found in your travels. In addition it can also be used to gain access to special locked rooms inside NPC dungeons.

Attack Power: Good  
Magic Power: None  
Armor: Average  
Health: Average

**Fighting  
**After you have done the Training - Combat quest you will have gained some weapons, this section of the guide will focus on the use of Daggers in your Estate Supply Box rather than other weapons, although the information can be applied to most weapons.

As a rogue you can dual wield weapons, so you should equip the dagger you get and buy a second dagger from Monty, dual wielding does not make you do twice as much damage as people who wield one weapon but it does make it so that your secondary weapon (right hand) is used randomly in combat giving you an added boost over someone using a one handed weapon.

As with all weapons making sure you have the best dagger for your level will ensure you do optimum damage, there are new materials generally every 5 levels so you should be able to upgrade your weapons every five levels, however there are not NPC shops every five levels so you may have to trade with other players or kill monsters or craft the items yourself to obtain them. The higher the level of the item the greater its DPR (Damage per round) rating and thus how much damage it can do.

After equipping your weapons, you can attack with them in combat. To attack an enemy in combat click the Attack button and you will swing at them.

**Lockpicking**  
To lockpick a locked container in your inventory, goto the Inventory screen, click on the locked container then click the Unlock button it will take you to the Unlocking screen and list all of the locked items in your inventory giving you one simple screen to unlock all of them. Once an item is unlocked you can use it or open it in your inventory as you would by opening any container.

To lockpick a locked training box (inside a room) simply click on the box you will be told if you fail or succeed.

To lockpick your way into a locked NPC dungeon room equip a lockpick (can be bought from a general store), stand adjacent to the locked room then click the pick button in the middle of the screen.

**Crafting Daggers (after you leave the Estate)  
**If you wish to be totally self sufficient you will need to make your own weapons for example a dagger, to do that you will need the following skills:

_Dagger  
_Ingot (main ingredient) - Made from ore using the Blacksmithing skill, Ore is gathered using Mining  
Small Blade Hilt - Made from Ingots using the Blacksmithing skill, Ingots are made using Blacksmithing from ore gathered using Mining.

So as you can see to make a dagger you only need Mining and Blacksmithing, the main ingredients used in the creation of both types of weapons is metal, which means that keeping Mining and Blacksmithing at your maximum skill value will enable you to make a good dagger for your level.

Incase you werent aware the main ingredient in crafting, usually shows up in bold text or in gold text and it is the ingredient that determines the final level of the item you are making, so if you use a level 10 ingot in your dagger you get a level 10 dagger the level of the other ingredients doesnt matter you can use level 1 materials for those which is why you only need to have trained the other skills to be able to make the weapons yourself.

It is possible to skip some of these skills and get other players to make components for you, or to get other players to make your weapons.

**Future Choices**  
As a rogue at level 50 you can evolve into one of three professions:

1.  Pickpocket
2.  Shadowstalker
3.  Trickster

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.
