Allowed Armor: **Cloth** **Leather**  
The Mercenary class has the following combat weapon skills to choose from:

*   Axes

The Mercenary class is a special class that does not start in the normal lands, instead you begin life as an enslaved Gladiator in a realm the Gods use for entertainment.

Combat works differently in the Gods realm, and violence and Player vs Player interactions are actively encouraged as gods are blood thirsty!

After you start out make sure you take the items out of your Mercenary chest, and use the training box you find within.

This will give you a bunch of neat Mercenary equipment (armor) a Mercenary Brand and a Half axe. Some of these items will need to be taken out of the Inventory > Containers > Trade Bag screen before you can equip them.

Attack Power: Good  
Magic Power: None  
Armor: Average  
Health: Average

**Fighting**  
You should equip both axe via the Inventory > Equipment screen (choose Left hand) this will allow you to use special Gladiator axe powers in combat.

As with all weapons making sure you have the best Axe for your level will ensure you do optimum damage, there are new materials generally every 5 levels so you should be able to upgrade your weapons every five levels by buying them from the NPC in town or from killing the NPC and looting them. You will also find the Gods have more powerful weapons on offer if you are willing to complete their quests via the Altar at the same location as the town. The higher the level of the item the greater its DPR (Damage per round) rating and thus how much damage it can do.

Gladiator Combat is a lot different to normal combat, you will notice this when you go to attack something.

Instead of a ton of buttons you will typically have no more than 6 to press. These buttons have the following effects:

*   Heal (Lightning flash), you ask your gods for a helping hand. If you are lucky they will take a mark of honor/dishonor and give you a heal.
*   Entertain, you ask your gods for some entertainment points. If you are lucky they will take a mark of honor/dishonor and give you some free points. 
*   Heal, uses entertainment points and provides a modest healing benefit for several rounds.
*   Generic Attack, uses a weak attack that requires simply one entertainment point.
*   Specific Weapon Attacks, depending on the weapons you have attacked you will see a random selection of attack powers. These have varying entertainment point requirements.

Entertainment Points basically act as energy, the more entertainment points you have the more powerful attacks you can pull off. You gain entertainment points by pleasing your gods and making them entertained.

To begin combat click on a Gladiator Monster (or if you are wishing to fight an NPC / Player mouse over them and click the Attack button).

The winner of the fight is chosen when all other opponents are dead, the gods may be pleased by long running fights and grant additional bonuses.

**Future Choices  
**As a mercenary at level 50 you can evolve into the Gladiator class, then at level 300 the Vanquisher and finally at level 600 the Champion.

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.

In a change to existing professions this class does not gain new skills when you evolve, instead it gains a "Skill learning deed". This deed can be used to train in a new skill of your choosing (from a list), in this way your Gladiator will be totally unique to you and not an exact copy of another.

Later evolutions also gain better armor.
