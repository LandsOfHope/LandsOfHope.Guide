<i>If you find that perfect spot in the country, with panoramic views and a fishing hole just a stone throw away and wish you could lay claim to the land !</i>
<br><br>
Well you can, if the piece of land is for sale or you have one of the land ownership bought extras you can buy or claim the spot of land as your own.<br><br>
When you own a piece of land you can determine who may build on it, and hand out building permits to all those you wish to be able to.
<br><br>You can also hand out relocation permits which allow people to move a building from another tile to your tile, great if you wish to move a building to the security of your own land.
<br><br>You can also set taxes so that players who do build here have to pay you money (the building maintenance fee), in general everyone whether owning a building on a player tile or not has to pay maintenance fee, a tile owner can however alter the amount that needs to be paid and that money will go to them instead.<br><br>
<b>Buying a Tile</b>
<br>Use the Land > Buy Land screen to check to see if a tile is currently for sale, the screen works like most of the map screens so you can use the white arrow buttons to move the displayed area around so you can cover the entire map without moving ... land for sale shows up in color with a purple marker arrow. Click on a tile once you find one for sale and it will tell you the price and provide you with a button to purchase it.<br><br>
If you do not find a tile that is for sale but still wish to buy a tile and you know no one has claimed it yet, then you can purchase either the Orb of Terraforming or the Genesis Orb these allow you to claim 5 or 10 tiles of land as your own as long as they are not already claimed.<br><br>After purchasing the extra, take it out of your Trade Bag then use it from your Inventory to show a screen like the Buy Land screen which lets you find your perfect tile.
