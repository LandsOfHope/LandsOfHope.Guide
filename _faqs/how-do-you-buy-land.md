Land>Buy land use the arrows to move around the map (like the normal maps and resorce maps). The map is in black and white, but it a piece of land is for sale it will show up in color. Click on the piece of land in color to find the price, and if you have enough money you can press the buy button. if not it will show you how much more money you need. Now some realms no longer have land avaliable to buy from the system. So what youll need to do is buy the orb extras to claim any non system or already owned tiles.
