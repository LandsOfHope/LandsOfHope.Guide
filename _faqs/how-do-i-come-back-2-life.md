Visit a Healer NPC or use a Shrine of Life item.

If you are on the estate still click on the Star beneath the Mini-map this will teleport you back to where you started, then click on the pot of water in the room.

If you have left the estate, type 31, 59 into the x and y coordinate box under the mini-map to travel to Springlade town then click on the Healer NPC.
