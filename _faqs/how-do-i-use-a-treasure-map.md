Make sure you have bought a spade from the traveling vendor and equiped it first. Then use the treasure map, it will bring up a map screen with a box to the right with a little flavor text and the level you must be to dig up the treasure. Click that box. You will be sent to the square, you will notice a small dig button in the middle of the screen. Click it and the treasure will be dug up.
