There are a number of pet ownership/control skills. Summoners get summoning skill - can summon monsters. Invokers get Invocation - can invoke monsters. Warlocks get Demonology - can tame Demons. Necromancers get Necromacy - can tame undead monsters and bring dead monsters back to life as your pet. There are other skills not just ones casters can eventually get. You are most likely too low level to evolve into any profession which gets these skills. Library > Races and Professions > Profession Evolution. However anyone who has a pet can give it to you as there is no requirement for owning a pet.
