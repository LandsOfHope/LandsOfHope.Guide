A sale can be one of the following: -Selling an item on a Vendor you own -Another player using one of your crafting skills on the Craft Marketeer -Another player using your Appraisal/Deconstruction or Lockpicking skill via the Appraiser NPCs. In any of these situations you earn money ... you can make your skills private so they can not be used by other players if you wish. File > Options > Character, Tick Private Skills
