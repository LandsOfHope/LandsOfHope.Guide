For many years we had an announcement system that sent a message to the status window, however many people missed vital announcements. Sometimes I send very important announcements that need to be read and if people do not read them It can cause problems, especially if these people ask why something was changed or report a change as a bug when I had explained in an announcement why it was made. The new system pops up a window with recent announcements to prevent people from missing them.
