Land ownership is supposed to be a special oppertunity those with the money can plan to achieve. If you want to have a tile that isnt for sale naturally, or isnt a system (NPC) tile.,You can get one of the orb extras to claim ownership of any unclaimed tile. (C & P - Sevare) More land tiles will be made available at a later date .. but Land is a priviledge not a certainty.
