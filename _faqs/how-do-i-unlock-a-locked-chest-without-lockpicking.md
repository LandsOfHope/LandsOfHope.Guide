There are several ways, 1 is to goto Northglen 27, 47 if the item is in your backpack, enter Northglen Town building and speak to the locksmith in the back room. Another is to trade the item to a player who has lockpicking skill, yet another way would be to buy the Master Key bought extra using File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items. The Final way would be to make a Rogue character and level it up.
