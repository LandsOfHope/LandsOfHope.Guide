Some skills that are harder to do things like Skinning often give one point each time, when I say hard to do I mean they take a long time or would have been too hard to raise directly. All skills that work like this give a "purple" skill gain message. Not all the skills are like this, for example Husbandry can be done on one screen over and over again if you are milking etc ... and some actions that do not kill the target out right. The only easier way I know of is to do actions that do not kill the target, if you kill it each time then you will be slower.
