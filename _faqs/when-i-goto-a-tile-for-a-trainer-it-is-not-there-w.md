Many of the Trainers are inside buildings that do not show up until they have been explored. The Exploration skill lets you explore buildings, this skill can be got from the NPC in Springlade. You will need to raise the skill to uncover certain buildings or else know someone (or wait for someone) to uncover the building so you can enter it. Once a building is explored it remains accessible for up to an hour and then returns to being unexplored.
