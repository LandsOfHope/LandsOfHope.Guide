Pets have lower stats and skills than a Monster, if you tamed a Monster you would find that your pets stats and skills are a little lower than they were before you tamed. This is intentional as domestication makes things weaker and less potent, however pets will still be a useful addition to the game and one that the Main Pet classes will find especially useful.
