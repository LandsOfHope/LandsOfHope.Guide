'Transferrable' refers to your ability to transfer your Hope Credits to other players.

Any Hope Credits that are purchased are transferrable, without restriction.

Non-transferrable credits are locked to your account, and may be granted to you by Lands Of Hope staff in certain rare circumstances such as server-wide special events, or as official contest prizes.

Whenever you redeem your HC for anything, any non-transferrable credits that you have will be applied first before falling back to your transferrable balance.
