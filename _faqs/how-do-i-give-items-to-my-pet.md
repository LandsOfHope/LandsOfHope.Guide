Trade to it like it was any other Player ... to do this goto the same tile as it (if its following you then you dont have to move). Goto Character > Trade ... select what you wish to give to it and then click the Next button at the bottom, then on the next screen you will be able to choose it as a recipient. To take items from your pet or to equip it use the minions > manage screen there are buttons there to recover items and equip as well as a host of other features.
