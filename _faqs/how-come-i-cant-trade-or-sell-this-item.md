There is a system that enables you to flag/deflag items you can use these flags to stop you accidentally trading, dropping or selling an item. They are quite useful, if you acquired an item from someone else they may have turned these flags on or the item may have started with these flags enabled, you can use the Inventory > Flags screen to turn them on or off. There are some exceptions to this a few items just cant be traded and Bought Extra Items can not be traded.
