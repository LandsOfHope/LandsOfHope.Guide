All Items have a level requirement, its possible that the level requirement for the item is too high at the moment. You can visit the Inventory screen and use the Info button to find out the level of the item. Also there are 4 types of armor, Cloth, Leather, Mail and Plate depending on your profession you might be limited to only cloth while the piece of armor is plate or mail. As you evolve you might unlock additional types of armor.
