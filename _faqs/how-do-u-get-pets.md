Pets can be bought on the Marketeer. Pets can be given to you by another player. Special pets can be bought with real money via the Bought Extras screen. Pets can be tamed. Different professions have different types of taming. Archers can evolve into Beastmasters that can tame animals. Fighters can evolve into Warlords that can tame humanoids. Casters can evolve into either Necromancers that can tame undead or Warlocks that can tame demons. The bought profession hermit can evolve into a Druid that can tame plants.
