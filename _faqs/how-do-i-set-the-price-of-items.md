If you wish to sell items on a Vendor you own you need to set the prices of the items. You can do this via the Inventory > Price screen before you trade the items to your pet or via the Minions > Manage (click Pet) Price button if the items are already on the pet. You can set prices individually or use the Fast Price buttons at the bottom to set the prices quickly.
