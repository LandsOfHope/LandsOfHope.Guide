We can only accept USD, this is because we can not afford to absorb the cost of converting currency on such a small amount of money nor can we guarantee the stability of any currency other than USD. If you live in another country and do not own a Pay Pal account you should be able to find a branch of Western Union or another company who can handle International Money Orders.
