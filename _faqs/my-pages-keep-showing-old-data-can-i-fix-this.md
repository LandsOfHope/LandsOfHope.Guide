Of course you can, if using Internet Explorer 6.0+, here is the fix:  
1\. While in the browser click Tools > Internet Options..  
2\. This will open a new window. Click the "Settings.." button in the middle of the page.  
3\. Another window will open. Click the first option button (Something like "Check for new page every visit")  
4\. Now click Ok, and Ok again. You may need to reopen your browser or restart your computer depending on your options.
