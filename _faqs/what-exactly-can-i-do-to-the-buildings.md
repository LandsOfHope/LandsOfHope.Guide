Via the Buildings button you can access a manage screen for ALL buildings on a land tile you own, regardless of if you own the building or not. This screen lets you rename the building, set the Taxation level of the building (0 - 100%), change the image of the building and set the survival skills or detect hidden requirements for the building. You can also destroy the building or use a button to add NPCs/Manage NPCs inside the building.
