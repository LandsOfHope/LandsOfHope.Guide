Nope anyone can join an allegiance so long as they are below level 150, after level 150 you can not choose an allegiance because of the challenge system needing fixed numbers and because it would be all too easy for a neutral player to have the benefits of being neutral for 1000 levels then join an allegiance when they see one winning at the Challenges.
