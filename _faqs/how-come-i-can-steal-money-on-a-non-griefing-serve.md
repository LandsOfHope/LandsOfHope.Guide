The theft system in LoH allows you to steal money however it is not money that the player themselves has access to it is something I call the Hidden Purse its basically a purse of money that is added to whenever a player makes money. The purse does not detract from the players own earnings and they are not aware of it, so when someone steals from it the player never finds out and so its not really a form of griefing.
