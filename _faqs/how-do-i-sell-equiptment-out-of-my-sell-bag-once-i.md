To sell equipment you can go to either a Healer NPC (there is one at Springlade) or a Store NPC (there is one inside Springlade).

When you click on a Healer NPC click the Sell Items button at the bottom of the screen.

When you click on a Store NPC it will automatically show your Sell Items screen.
