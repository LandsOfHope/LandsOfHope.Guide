If you are neutral you do not get bonus allegiance rewards as you are not in an allegiance. You can not take part in the Battlefield which means you lose access to Legendary weapons, you can not siege because there is nothing for you to siege. The advantages are being able to deal with people from all allegiances for trading purposes and such.
