There are several hidden buildings at 44,88 Fenwood Town (Sandydale Basin). These need to be explored with the Exploration skill, if you do not have this skill you can ask another player to explore them ...

The buildings will then show up for 30 minutes, and revert back to hidden after that time so they will need to be explored.

One of the hidden buildings is the construction trainer.
