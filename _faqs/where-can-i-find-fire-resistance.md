As a bonus on items, or from magic spells or from potions (tonics) or food supplements. Go to Library > Advanced Search, click the Items tab and enter Fire Resistance in the box and click search it will show you any items that naturally come with fire resistance. This may not be very many, Fire Resistance is also available as a random enchantment bonus on magical items. I believe Casters may also get fire resistance buffs.
