To learn a new spell you must have the right magic skill for the spell, you must also have the right amount of skill for the spell and finally you must visit the right trainer. As there are hundreds of spells per spell line there are multiple spell trainers that each teach a fixed range of spells, when you click on a spell trainer it says the skill range the trainer will teach in the status window. To find the right trainer use the Help > Manual > Knotwood Valley guide page or World > World (click guide button).
