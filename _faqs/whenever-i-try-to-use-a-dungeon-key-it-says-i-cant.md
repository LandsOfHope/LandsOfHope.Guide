name: Whenever I try to use a dungeon key, it says I can`t use it there. I`ve went to random places on the map, and it always says the same thing, why is it that I can`t use it?

You can only use a key on a tile that is both not owned by another player and not a special game tile that prevents housing.

Try going further away from town, and perhaps trying a tile in the water as it is less likely it will have a building on it.

You can use the Info button at the bottom of the screen to see if a tile is owned before using the key if you like.
