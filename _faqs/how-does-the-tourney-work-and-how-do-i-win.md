Well there are 3 different tournaments, each one has different rules as to how you win it. Some are for the most kills, the most prize money won etc .... You have ot be in it to win it as they say, goto the Arena at Springlade and talk to the Tourney Host he will also set you up with fights, you can only fight players who are online at the time but you can fight people across both servers. You can not fight the same person more than once every 30minutes, so that stops people exploiting the system.
