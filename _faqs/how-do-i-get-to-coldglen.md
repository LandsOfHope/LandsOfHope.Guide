To get to Coldglen you need Cold Survival skill, there are a number of ways to get this. They arent necessarily easy there is a quest obtainable from an NPC at 27 17 Knotwood Valley, who will reward you with a Potion to let you get there. Alchemists can also make potions to let you travel through Cold terrains.
