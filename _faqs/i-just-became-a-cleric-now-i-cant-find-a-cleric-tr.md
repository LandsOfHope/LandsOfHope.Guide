You cant get the quest to Coldglen until your level 65, but if you follow the path north where it crosses over from grass to snow/ice there is a small outpost with an NPC that gives the quest. Alternatively a Tailor, Alchemist and Cook can make an item with a bonus to Cold Survival ... I would try hunting in the desert and find a Cyan crystal so the trip to Coldglen is easier.
