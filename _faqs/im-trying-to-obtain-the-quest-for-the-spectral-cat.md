name: I`m trying to obtain the quest for the Spectral Cat in the afterlife. I read about it in the LIbrary under the Afterlife expansion. It told me to go to 25,25 and talk to an NPC there and use explore to make the building show up if it does not appear. I`ve done this and all I get is the NPC who gives me a riddle. How do I obtain this quest? Please advise. Thank you!

There are 30 or so riddle pieces in the Afterlife Realm you have to find them all, construct the riddle and then answer the NPC with the correct answer to get in and see the NPC with the quest.
