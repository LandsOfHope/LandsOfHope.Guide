Lots of NPCs default to a Sell screen when you click on them some show a different screen but may have a Sell Items button at the bottom of the screen. You can sell to Healers, shop owners etc .... the Sell Items screen defaults to showing all of the items in your sell bag you can put things into your sell bag by using the red arrow below the bag on the Inventory screen. Alternatively the Sell screen has options to view other bags to sell from.
