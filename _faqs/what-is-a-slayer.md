Well I am assuming you mean the title? .... When you kill 5000 of a specific race you can gain a slayer title for example kill 5000 cats and you can get the Cat Slayer title. To check how many kills you have go to the Character > Statistics > Kills screen. To toggle between any titles you may have unlocked use the Character > Appearance Profile screen.
