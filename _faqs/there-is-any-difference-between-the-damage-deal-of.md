There is no difference between any of the weapon skills. The two handed weapons do more damage than a one handed weapon but two one handed weapons do close to the damage of one two handed weapon. Aside from the difference between one handed and two handed weapons there is no difference between the damage they do. It was made this way so that your weapon choice is less constricting, you dont have to choose a weapon skill because it does more damage like you often have to do in other game. You can instead choose a weapon because it matches your character plans (as long as your profession gets the skill of course).
