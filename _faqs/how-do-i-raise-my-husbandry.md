I am going to assume you have just bought the skill so have 5pts in it, go to the tile one square north of springlade where the level 1 cows spawn, move the mouse over the cow there is a button in the center which says "care" (well there are 2 care buttons the first one is the one you want the second is for a pet you have with husbandry skill to care for the target). Click the button it will show a list of things you can do to that critter as part of your caring process. Some actions destroy/kill the monster, but others like milking can be repeated. Once you get to 25 skill move to level 5 things ...
