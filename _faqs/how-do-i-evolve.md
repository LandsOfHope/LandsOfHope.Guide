There are NPCs in the lands who can help you evolve, these Evolved Spirits will allow you to reach out from your current form and evolve into something quite special. There is an Evolved Spirit in the Tower across the lake from Springlade (South Glade Tower), there is also one at 13, 53 in the Riverscape realm and 3, 69 in the Barren Downs.
