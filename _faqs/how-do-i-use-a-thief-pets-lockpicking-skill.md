You need to Possess it to do so, and unless you are a Necromancer and have the Possession skill or have bought the Skull of Corruption buyable extra you cant possess it. Pets are not meant to be able to do everything a player can, while they can do most things and I am adding new features to Pets it seems stupid for them to be able to do everything given that players can own many pets it devalues the point of having characters if you can just get a pet to do everything your character can not.
