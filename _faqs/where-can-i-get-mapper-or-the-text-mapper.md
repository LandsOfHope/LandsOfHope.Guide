You can get either from the downloads page at http://www.fho2.com/downloads.php From the 10th of December 2005, the Text/Lite Mapper written by Taalen is included in the full download for the Graphical Mapper written by GM Decius. If you need support for the Lite/Text version please contact Taalen, otherwise contact GM Decius or use the Support@fho2.com email address.
