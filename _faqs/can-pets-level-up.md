Yes, they level up, you need to get them to urn XP tho ... this can be done either by having them in combat as a combat pet or by having them gather / craft. There is a Help topic at Help > Help Topics, called Gathering using Pets which explains gathering. When your pet has enough xp to gain a level a button shows up on the Minions > Manage screen called "Level"
