Yes and no, it is free to play for as long as you want however you can not go above level 100 if you do not pay. Paying the one time fee of 15USD will let you go above level 100.  
  
Please remember a lot of time has gone into developing this game and all costs have so far been paid by the game creator Daniel Paull.
