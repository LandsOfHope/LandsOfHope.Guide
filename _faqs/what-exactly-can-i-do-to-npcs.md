Via the NPC button you as Mayor of a tile can add 2 NPCs on the actual Tile and 2 NPCs inside any building on the tile (via the Buildings button). These NPCs can also be managed via the Minions > Manage > NPC screen. Your owned NPCs act just like real NPCs and will not count towards your Pet Limit. As Mayor you can set the name and title of the NPC, its race and sex as well as what type of NPC it is.
