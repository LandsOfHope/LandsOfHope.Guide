If you havent already downloaded the Full Install you must download and then install this to play the game. If you have installed the full install then its likely due to the fact that you installed the game files to a directory other than the default, if this is the case then you need to goto your Account screen click on the Settings button and enter the new Install Path using the format it shows. After you have done this close down the game windows and log back in and things should look better.
