There are a few ways to do this, first make sure you have trained your pet in the skill when you visit a Skill Trainer there is a button at the bottom called "Pet" that you can use to train a pet. Next up if you are using a screen resolution of 1024 \* 768 or higher goto File > Options > Extra Bar and turn on the "Pet" Extra Bar. You should now get a list of pets on the right of the screen in the Extra Bar area, the list has a Map button to the right of each pet, you can click this button to view a Resource Map screen for the pet (same as going to World > Resources and clicking the Yellow Pet button on that screen) .... click on the type of resource you wish to gather using the buttons on the right of the Resource screen, this should then show a list of resources near by although you may have to move the displayed area around using the White Arrow buttons. Click on a Resource to goto that location next up you need to get your pet to gather whatever it is at that spot, to do that click on the Pet on the Extra Bar (not the map button this time) or goto Minions > Manage and click on the Pet and click Control. It will now display the Pet Control screen, at the bottom of which will be a display of the resources at this location including whatever it is you are after click on the resource to show the gather screen and keep gathering till the resource expires. Use the Queue screen to see the status of the queue.
