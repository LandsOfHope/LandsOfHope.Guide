There are actually three cities in Knotwood, there are normally between two and three cities in each map with numerous smaller outposts and Allegiance outposts. The gaps in levels of equipment available due to towns not being present every five levels are intentional so that player crafters have business. Not to mention 20 towns per map is something that would be totally unnecessary.
