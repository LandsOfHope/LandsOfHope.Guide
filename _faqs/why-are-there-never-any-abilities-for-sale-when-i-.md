Well there are two types of trainers, Skill Trainers these are the ones that teach skills, Plan/Style/Spell trainers these are the ones that teach plans or styles or spells. When you click on the latter it tells you in the status window what skill range of plans/styles and spells that trainer can teach and for what skills, if you have already learnt all of the the things you can learn in that skill range you need to go to the next trainer. As trainers only teach a set range.
