They are the four currencies of the game, when you kill monsters some drop money, others drop items and sometimes both money and items are dropped. You can sell items (loot or crafted) to NPCs to gain money as well. 100bp = 1sp, 100sp = 1gp, 100gp = 1pp money is converted automatically as required so when you get 100bp you will see you have an extra sp rather than 100bp.
