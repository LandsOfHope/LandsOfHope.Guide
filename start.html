This is a simple Walkthrough, which should see you get through Level 1 and get all the gear you need to start fighting as well as learn the basics of quests, equipment, inventory and resting ! 
<br><br>
As a new player you will begin on the Tutorial Estate, this is a relatively small area, you will be greeted by an NPC ... Guide Derwa she will explain some things to you and offer you a quest. 
<br><br>
<b>Note: You start naked, with no clothing, weapons or armor as you are a newly acquired slave to Baron Drako. The quests shown below offer clothing, armor and weapons as rewards, without them you will find it very hard going.</b>

<script>DrawTT2('Training - Talking','Guide Derwa will offer you a talking quest, its simple enough to complete after accepting the quest move one tile north, you can do this by clicking on the Mini-map on the left side of the screen.<br><br><table class="weakcell"><tr><td><img src="images/minimap.gif"></td><td valign=top><font color=gold>Your current position is marked by a red bouncing arrow (purple/pink arrows often indicate a place of interest or NPC location at least on the estate).</font><br>Your position: <img src="images/ayou.gif"><br>Place of Interest: <img src="images/nyou.gif"></td></table><br><br> Simply click on the tile that is directly to the north and you will move to that position, where upon you will see three NPCs and perhaps one or two player characters (other players like yourself starting out on the Estate).<br><br><font color=gold>The quest was to talk to Patricia so click on Patricia, this will open the quest window and allow you to continue with the quest/complete it, if you click on an NPC and it doesnt open the quest window you may find a Quest button at the bottom of the screen it does open or else you can launch the quest window by moving the mouse over the NPC and then in the central area where the action buttons show up there will be a quest button for you to click.</font><br><br>Speak to Patricia, you are then told to Return to Derwa, do not take the quest to kill Chickens Patricia has until you have gained your equipment.<br>', 1, 'Guide Derwa', 'Basic quest to get you used to moving and talking to NPCs.');
DrawTT2('Training - Equipment','Derwa asks you to go and find Monty Smith, well he is on the same tile as Patricia, so go one tile North. In this instance Monty is a vendor, so clicking him will open the Vendor Buy/Sell screen you can then click the Quests button at the bottom of the screen, or mouse over Monty and click the Action Quest button. Doing so will get you a shirt and trousers ... now you wont be so darn naked !<br><br><font id=tgold>You can equip these new items go to Inventory > Equipment. Now, click on one of the locations at the top of the screen (Example: Left Hand, Right Hand, head, etc.) You will then notice that as you click a list of items that is available for you to equip will appear below, as you only have a few items most of the slots will be greyed out but a few such as the Bonus slot, Chest and Legs slots will be available. Click on those slots and then click on the top item that is displayed (the top item is the highest level item and therefore assumed to be the best, although you may later on decide to equip items based on another rule). When an Item is equipped it shows up Purple all other colors are used to indicate the location of the item or the quality.<br><br>Under the Bonus slot you should have Drakos Brand, this is a special item you got and is very very useful .... equip it like the other items and then goto the Inventory > Spells screen, there is a spell on the item that you can activate (lasts 60minutes) to give yourself a nice boost of health.</font><br><br>Even with these new items we are still not ready to go out and fight just yet so do not think you can .... you might get lucky and win a few times but you still need a weapon !<Br><br>Monty should have asked you to go back to Guide Derwa, if you do so you can end the quest and take a new quest called Training - Combat.<br>', 1, 'Guide Derwa', 'Basic quest to get you used to moving and talking to NPCs.');
DrawTT2('Training - Combat','This is a simple enough quest, after taking it you can complete it right away and doing so will reward you with a <b>Estate Supply Box</b>, goto your Inventory > Containers screen and click on the Supply Box and then click the Use button on the right of the screen, from the box you will gain a few items, some armor and in most cases a weapon. You might also gain a spell book if your profession is caster based.<br><br><font color=gold>You can equip your items via the Inventory > Equipment screen you used earlier, after changing your equipment (and casting spells like Drakos Brand) your Health/Mana may not be 100% anymore, to get it back to full you should goto the World > Rest screen ... resting is one of the ways to regenerate your stats and is vital to do before going into a fight if you are not at full Health/Mana as you will be more vulnerable without full stats.</font><br>', 1, 'Guide Derwa', 'Gets you your Profession equipment, weapons and armor and enables you to fight.');
DrawTT2('Training - Casting / Healing','If you follow the path from Derwa North/West you will come to the Library ... the Librarian will offer a simple quest that can be done at Level 2 and will give you access to some spells. -These are vital initially for casters as weapons are not a casters strong point, although many casters can use Staves.<br>',1,'Librarian','Enables Casters and Healers to get a few basic spells at Level 2.<br><br>While any Profession can do this quest the reward item (Spellbook) given will only work for a profession that gets magic spells.');

<b>General Notes</b><br>
Lands of Hope is controlled almost entirely by mouse, there are some short cut keys and the Arrow Keys on the Keyboard may also be used to move your Avatar around the mini-map, although for anyone skilled with a mouse clicking on the Tile on the mini-map to move there is a lot faster. 
<br><br>
For Example: 
<ul><li>Clicking on an NPC will try to talk with them. </li>
<li>Clicking on a Monster will try to attack it. </li>
<li>Clicking on a map tile, room will move to that location. </li></ul>

At the top of the game screen is a series of Menus, these give you access to hundreds of screens (there are over 600 screens in LoH), you should try each menu at least once so you know where some screens are some of the screens like the Inventory > Equipment screens are essential to your character, this screen is how you equip and unequip your items. <br><br>

As you change equipment, you may find your Health and Mana does not regenerate to full, this is normal. There is no regenerate over time feature, instead if you find your Health or Mana is not full goto World > Rest and you will rest and regenerate to full. 
<br><br>
If you die, you will become a ghost and your map may go gray, this is so you know you are dead ... you may also notice you are dead by the fact no one shows up in the main window and you might see ??? as the name of your current location. If you are dead you must seek out a Healer or a Shrine of Life, healers are very common and can be found in most towns ... if you find you die on the Tutorial Estate there is a Button at the top of the screen to the right of your Character Name, which is labeled "Return to Quarters" you can use this to return to Guide Derwas hut, and one square north of this is a Healer. 
<br><br>

The tutorial covers 5 levels of gameplay, at level 5 you are summoned to go speak to the Baron who will grant you your freedom at which point you get to access the real game, with its 100,000+ tiles to explore and extensive skill systems.
