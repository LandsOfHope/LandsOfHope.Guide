The sight of the dark cloak or the skeletal face, with heavy blood-red eyes, underneath the deep hood usually means certain death for a very unfortunate individual.   Often, a reaper will carry a single weapon in their skeletal hands in order to persuade unwilling victims to suffer their punishment. This weapon is usually a long, two-handed scythe, but some have been known to wield a sickle or kunai with chains.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The bringers of death, Grim reapers are the key-holders of the underworld.  Silent and swift, Grim reapers enact final judgment on all who deserve it.  Their scythes are the symbol of vengeance, and their cloaks hide the power of eternal shadow, an unbreakable bind that, once placed, condemns any unfortunate soul to everlasting torment for the wrongs they have done. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Before the coming of the first Reaper horde, a Grim reaper was thought to be a welcomed sight.  Its coming was thought to be a sign of just vengeance on the wicked or even as a well deserved rest for the suffering righteous.  It was not uncommon for the family of a deathly ill person to claim that they had seen a reaper enter or exit the quarters of the bedridden and afflicted, gently releasing the dying of their earthly suffering.  <br>
<br>
But as certain of those known as the Followers began to drift closer to darkness, pacts between the Grim reapers and the Necromancers forged alliances that would eventually evolve into the founding of the Reaper horde.  Villagers throughout the kingdom began to associate the coming of a Grim reaper as a sign of impending doom.  No longer were the righteous taken to peaceful rest by a reaper; they were instead forced into servitude under the command of the Undead.  In the wake of a reaper coming was always a Reaper massacre.  Indeed, it is believed that the race of Grim reapers was the first of the Reaperï¿½s Red Death units.<br>
