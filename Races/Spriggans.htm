                        sized boulder. Though it has been known that Spriggans can "grow" as large as a three ton
                        boulder. Generally their color is that of the surronding rock. If you look carefully, you can
                        make out a face.<br></td>

                        subterranian homes. The difference is Spriggans are made purely out of rock, and are in essence,
                        living rock, giving them excellent control over it. They, like the rest of their kin, can float
                        above the ground.<br></td>

                        older than most recorded history. Though a recent expedition to the mountains of Royal Hollow
                        had seen them in their natural enviroment when one inadvertantly ran over one of the expedition
                        team. Like Bogles, they have been misclassified as Elementals of the plane of earth.<br></td>
