<table class='barCell2' style='width: 415; cursor: none' cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td colspan='2' valign=top><table class='weakcell' width='100%' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td colspan='2'><b>Classification: Undead</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>Appearance</b><br><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/r/el1.gif' title='Male Picture' align=left><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/r/el2.gif' title='Female Picture' align=left>Necrotic warriors were, often times, once human.  Since being exposed to necromantic spells, their bodies have begun to waste away, giving them a sort of dried or mummified appearance.  Their skin is often quite pale and shrunken, tight to the bones.  Their cheeks are sunken; their eyes are dark and glossy with apparent decay.<br>
<br>
Though its body is in a state of waste, the physical abilities of the necrotic warrior actually improve.  Warriors are unnaturally strong, and they have been known to match stallions in full gallop on foot.  Rarely, however, do they exhibit these abilities at their fullest, for they prefer to wear heavy armor and wield heavier weapons in order to protect their weakened and vulnerable bodies.<br>
<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>A race of corrupted souls, the necrotic warriors are a remnant of the First Horde.  Hungry for the blood of those who scorned them, and greedy for immortality, these warriors cloaked themselves in the powers of darkness.  Utilizing the lost arts of necromancy, these former Followers tainted their once living flesh with evil mana, morphing into creatures of war, neither living nor dead.  From their very beginnings, necrotic warriors have been an integral part of the Horde�s armed forces.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The Followers were not always obsessed with Darkness.  There was a time when they sought Light.  Indeed, they believed that all magic could be used for the greater good of all.  Many people were healed by the Followers with their mysterious mana.  Laborious hours were spent by these faithful men and women in research in order to understand and master techniques and spells beyond the average human�s abilities.<br>
<br>
However, the Followers were a misunderstood people.  They were feared by others for their practices, both of advanced magic and of the olden gods.  They were scorned and persecuted.  They were blamed for misfortune and mistreated out of spite.  Villages and towns exiled local Followers, banishing them from society.<br>
<br>
This is the time the great divide came upon the Followers.  The disillusioned and angry abandoned the Light for Darkness; the rest went into hiding.  Necrotic warriors gave birth to more wretched creatures, and the dead rose from the earth.  The First descended on Myzan and war ensued.  Many were lost � until the Followers returned.  Only the brothers of the Dead could save the Living.  And so they did.  Afterward, they returned to exile, taking with them the dark secrets of now forbidden magic. <br>
