                        time of entombment, was soaked in an embalmment solution. The body was also treated in an effort
                        to preserve the deceased for as long as possible for the afterlife. These creatures exist,
                        therefore, because the preservation process was successful. The soul of the dead may find his
                        body too inviting or, perhaps, too difficult to leave behind. So he returns to his decaying
                        flesh and is cursed to walk the earth a rotting, skeletal wrap of stale flesh and dirty, worn
                        cloth, reduced to being a mindless, shuffling bag of aged, brittle bones.<br></td>

                        Some of Myzan�s oldest cultures have had religious beliefs that included some sort of afterlife.
                        In order to allow the soul to thoroughly enjoy death, certain religious practices required the
                        body of the dead to be preserved. Many different technologies were used to achieve this goal;
                        the most common and successful technique involved the wrapping of the body in a series of
                        ointment-soaked linens after undergoing an extensive purification process. It is from this and
                        similar techniques that advancements in food preservation such as smoking and salt bathing
                        originated.<br></td>
