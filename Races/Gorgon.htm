                            align=left>Thought to have once been among the most fair of all creation, Gorgons are
                        humanoid creatures that many deem hideous. They are not necessarily ugly, but their greenish
                        skin tones and scale-laced bodies don�t often win them many sutures from other, fairer, races.
                        It is said that the Gorgons were long ago cursed to be like unto the very snakes their ancestors
                        worshiped so diligently. Even now the Gorgons hide sharp fangs in their mouths and cover
                        intricate patterns of scales on their backs. Their eyes are sharp, and their forked tongues can
                        sense the air about them. Some even slither about on serpentine hindquarters below their very
                        human torsos. The most identifiable attribute of a Gorgon, however, is its hair � locks of
                        living snakes, or so it has been said.<br></td>

                        an ancient serpent god. They are guardians of the craggy heights of Myzan and are often
                        encountered along the trails that lead to the region of the Sister Dragons. They are known as
                        the Gorgons, a semi-serpentine people of warriors and mages content to watch over the misty
                        peaks they call home. They are not generally hostile or violent in nature, nor are they inclined
                        to join in the current conflict that has engulfed Myzan and its leading houses, Ramirez and
                        Osgaurd. So long as the Royal Heights are not threatened, the Gorgons would rather serve their
                        forgotten gods in peace. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>At one time the Gorgons were seen throughout Myzan and were a part
                        of the social order of the time. However, some believe that a wayward group among the Gorgons
                        angered the serpent god they served, and as punishment, the entire race was cursed to suffer the
                        lost of their former beauty forever, made to bare the attributes of the very god they
                        worshipped. To the mountains they fled, and defensive they became, ever content as days passed
                        to be reclusive.<br>
                        <br>
                        As time passed, and the Gorgons were passed from human memory, rumors spread concerning a vile
                        witch of snakes in the mountains. It was said that a evil creature with snakes for hair a stone
                        stare lurked about the rocks and brush in search of a stray man to call all her own. Such a
                        hideous monster she became in the minds of men that parties were formed to hunt her. They
                        scoured the mountainsides and terrorized lone Gorgons from the realms of the Seven Sisters to
                        the vales of Lakeview.<br>
                        <br>
                        The witch hunt went on with seemingly no end in sight as the men failed to find the fantasized
                        monster they sought. Memory of the Gorgons slowly returned to the minds of men. But tainted
                        those memories were, overshadowed in influenced by the irrational fears of men. Whatever evil
                        vexed the Gorgons ages ago had surely driven them to threaten all mankind with the prospect of
                        an eternity locked in stone. The Gorgons became a race of fear � fear of men and the fear of
                        men.<br>
                        <br>
                        The end came with a brave soul, a lone Gorgon maid, forever touched by grief for her people. She
                        alone willingly offered herself as the vile villainess the hunters wanted. They took her and put
                        and end to their hunts, with her head as their trophy. To this day, the Gorgons remember the
                        sacrifice of that selfless maiden. Forever will they honor Medusa.<br>
