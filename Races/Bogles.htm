They have been called dirty snowmen for their rounded body structure. They have bits of grass or other foliage on top of their heads like hair, and small gemstones for eyes. They tend to appear about half the size of a halfling most of the time, and despite the frown their faces form, are quite friendly to the shaman and the shaman`s friends, if not a bit shy. It is not known if they can choose their size at will like most of their kin.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>A race of fey, cousins of pixies, Bogles are small spirit creatures made of earth. While they are native to the material plane of Myzan, they are reclusive, usually only coming above their subterranean homes at the beck and call of a shaman. Despite being made of bits of earth, soil and rock, they can fly, or rather float, like all of their kin. They are kind but shy, usually hiding behind a shaman that summons them instead of fighting for them. Extreme cases are reported though of a bogle fiercely fighting for the shaman that has summoned them when it seems the shaman will meet an untimely end.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>It is said that the bogles helped shape Myzan, helping form its underground system of rivers and caverns. While most call this myth, most shamans agree that the bogles did shape Myzan, or at least the subterranean parts. Bogles are one of the oldest known spirit helpers for Shamans, their nature to help rather then pull pranks making them faithful companions. When the arcane schools first saw them, they conjectured that the bogles were merely infant earth elementals, but have since realized their true nature as the very spirits of myzans earth and soil, but since the belief of everything having a spirit has been outlawed along with most of the old ways, modern scholarly books have them misclassified as elementals.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>AIR SURVIVAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/396.gif'></td><td><b>pinch of pixie dust</b><br>Spawn Chance: 15%</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/rgf.gif'></td><td><b>Ring</b><br>Spawn Chance: 30%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Archer</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Begrimmer</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Blowbringer</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Woundtender</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
