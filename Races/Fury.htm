                            align=left>Furies are often confused as shying children or young maids when approached in
                        the darkness. Their cowering draws the concerned and unsuspecting close were they can see
                        pitiful, helpless eyes flare with devious intent and slender, pointed fingers curl in an
                        enticing invitation. Once drawn in, the true intent of the seemingly lost child is revealed to
                        the unfortunate good soul, too late for them to resist.<br>
                        <br>
                        Because they stay close to the shadows, furies are most attractive when seen in the errant light
                        of the moon. Their long, straight hair seems to shine in the light and hide pointed ears and
                        darkly cute faces with impish grins. Their slender frames are very elegant and swift when in
                        motion. Their skin is usually one of many shades of grey, purple, or blue � tones that help them
                        hide in the darkness.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Furies are a race of impish demons of the same order as banshees and
                        gibbers. They are not especially strong or menacing, nor are they very social creatures. They
                        tend to be fond of darkness and solitude, often frequenting dense woods or large, abandoned
                        estates under the cover of night. Most think of furies as shy creatures; the wise are those that
                        realize a fury is by no means shy or harmless, and that its attractive lure is what makes it
                        dangerous. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>There are stories of haunted mansions and abandoned estates from
                        which strange noises and eerie screams rise. There are also caves and sections of deep wood that
                        are feared as evil territory. Many of these stories are just that � stories. However, there are
                        some such legends that have been confirmed as haunting grounds for lone furies and banshees
                        alike.<br>
                        <br>
                        One such location is an old watchtower deep in the drifts of Three Glaciers. Once an important
                        military lookout and trading station, it fell into obscurity and was abandoned by the Royal
                        Army. The elements and time took their toll on the old wood and stone tower, nearly bringing it
                        down and leaving it near ruin. The few that have since traveled by this tower have reported
                        cries and piercing screams coming from the tower; the sounds could be heard for miles carried on
                        the snow-laced wind. There have been some brave enough to investigate the location, few have
                        returned.<br>
                        <br>
                        The survivors have all claimed the same thing. The tower is now the keep of a fury bent on
                        holding Three Glaciers as a claim of the Reapers. Anyone who comes too near or threatens the
                        Reaper Tower must be ready to face the rampage of the fury, closely watching from the shadows.
