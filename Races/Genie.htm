                        � usually an oil lamp. There are also female genies, and many a mortal man has clamored after
                        the possibly of finding a seductive wish-giver. No genie can be said to be ugly, indeed the
                        majority are as pleasing to look upon in their fine jewelry and cloths as the enticing elf. They
                        can appear as a vapor rising out of their medium or as a solid humanoid. The color of their
                        vapor/skin signifies their family lineage, and the tones can be used by others to tell their
                        gender.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The well-known �three wish� rule originated many, many years ago. An
                        old man found a genie�s lamp in the sand just outside his sea side home. Upon meeting his new
                        magical friend, the old man was excited at the possibilities. He could live forever and be
                        eternally youthful. He could have as much money and fame as he could want. But inside his heart,
                        he only had one wish. He wanted his only son to be happy.<br>
                        <br>
                        The son had spent his whole life caring for his father, who was slowly dying from a disease no
                        doctor could cure. His mother and sisters were all gone; they had sold themselves away to
                        strange men seeking money to help the old man, while the young man, only a small boy at that
                        distant time, was left to work hard and care for his father.<br>
                        <br>
                        The old man died without asking his genie for anything, not even comfort. Out of compassion, the
                        genie lent his services to the son. Immediately, the son demanded that the genie revive his
                        father, whole and without illness. The genie granted the son�s wish and the father was brought
                        to life. The son then demanded that his sisters and his mother be returned home; the wish was
                        granted. The son continued demanding wishes from the genie, and by the great Code of the Genie,
                        he complied, until finally, after many wishes that left the son and his family very rich and
                        famous in their land, the genie was ordered by the son to die. And by the great Code of the
                        Genie, he complied�<br>
                        <br>
                        No longer will a genie willingly give away infinite wishes. In fact, a genie will only grant his
                        service for a lifetime to a soul that has truly befriended him. As for the old man�s son, all
                        his fame, money, and even his family disappeared the moment the genie granted his last wish.<br>
