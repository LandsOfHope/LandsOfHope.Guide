                        from nose to tail tip with a wing span of eighty feet. Their appearance is exactly like the
                        common dragons in shape and detail but their skin is metallic and almost impossible to pierce.
                        Rather<br>
                        than having the gleam of gems for coloring like the common dragon, they appear in the various

                        A female dragon who is gravid begins to consume vast quantities of ore to help develop her eggs
                        which she then lays in a nest in the deepest area of her dwelling. Eighteen months later,
                        dragonettes hatch and immediately begin to fight over the territory of the nest with the
                        strongest surviving.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Many years ago a famous mastersmith of the dwarven race named Moloti
                        Farlode and his brother Vodim, an inventor, worked together in secret. In a hidden cave far from
                        the dwellings of other dwarves they worked day and night to craft the first metal dragon
                        thinking perhaps that they would be useful as mounts and weapons in the wars that dwarves love
                        to partake in.<br>
                        <br>
                        It is said from what clues were left that the two brothers began to argue about one point or
                        another in the construction and the arguement quickly got louder and louder drawing the
                        attention of Vadarmi, an insane sorceror, who was wandering the area. Spying the beautiful
                        construct, Vadarmi was filled with greed and desire. Joining in the fight, the sorceror began
                        tossing spells towards the brothers. Unfortunately, the two dwarves were also throwing things
                        and it is assumed that one spell bounced off an ingot and got directed at the dragon which then
                        came to life<br>
                        and ate all three combatants.<br>

                        Many adventurers have lost their lives by attempting to tame a metal dragon. It has never been
                        done. It is said that the metal dragons are untamable and unridable but the unteachable continue
                        to try and die.<br>
