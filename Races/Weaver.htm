                            align=left>The weaver is a horrible sight to see. Most humans have an innate fear of spiders
                        and to see a giant spider bearing a torso and head appearing human is enough to cause the
                        strongest warrior to shiver. The weavers have eight hairy long legs which they use to climb
                        their webs to feast on prey trapped and woven into a cocoon<br>
                        <br>
                        The skin of a weaver is most often a sickly looking bluish purple from its head to its bulbous
                        belly. They have no human features on their heads but instead have eyes and a mouth like a
                        spider which gives a truely nightmarish look to them. The body is built like spiders with a huge
                        swollen looking abdomen which bears spigots that<br>
                        the weaver uses to create its giant webs.<br>
                        <br>
                        An egg bearing race, there is nothing more horrible to see than hundreds of young weavers
                        advancing in hunger.<br>

                        clumps of hanging moss and vines. One usually finds they are close to a weaver`s lair when they
                        find themselves entangled in the thick, ropish sticky webs of its nest. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Weavers were born centuries ago when a beautiful, untrained mage
                        found a spell book lost after a battle. Delving into the pages, she found a spell for shape
                        changing and decided to attempt it. Little did she know that due to her lack of<br>
                        knowledge and skill she was only able to see a portion of the spell. Halfway through, she felt
                        tremendous agony as her body went into spasms and contortions that finally caused her to pass
                        out.<br>
                        <br>
                        When she woke up the mage was horrified to find out what she had become. She slipped away into
                        the forest with the book and spent the rest of her life trying to find a way back to herself.
                        Legend has it that the book still exists and that generations<br>
                        of her descendants still try to find ways to return to the human race.<br>
