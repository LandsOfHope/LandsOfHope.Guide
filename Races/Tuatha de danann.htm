                            title='Female Picture' align=left>The tribe of the Tuatha de danann is one of a group of
                        pixies that spend much of their time out of sight and undetected, going about their business in
                        relative solitude. They are rather small creatures, very human-like, often growing no larger
                        than five inches tall. They do not, however, allow their stature to detour their spirit as a
                        Tuatha will not hesitate to defend its charge if at all threatened. They often arm themselves
                        with spears and armor enchanted with various earth magics of which they are masters. <br>
                        <br>
                        The Tuatha de danann fly about on a set of paired wings, light and translucent. Up close, one
                        would notice the Tuathaï¿½s resemblance of the elves; they have thin eyebrows over keen eyes,
                        pointed ears, and silky hair oft worn long, over the shoulders, or tied. Unlike other pixies and
                        fairies, the Tuatha do not emit much light if any from their magic infused bodies, nor do they
                        trail mana enriched dust when they fly. They are, however, just as skilled at the creation of
                        fine pixie dust and magic rings as their many relatives.<br>

                        who do not understand the importance of their work. A warrior tribe of uncommon pixies, the
                        Tuatha travel about the land tending the earth and defending its well-being. The fruit of their
                        labor is enjoyed by all who themselves care deeply for the splendor and grandeur of nature.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>When the Angels were sent to create a place for the coming Newborns,
                        the Elements were fashioned. Flame, water, air, lightning, and earth were among those base
                        elements, and from those building blocks, Myzan was born. The power of the great Elements flow
                        throughout Myzan even to this day, and such power frequently tempts those who would seek it for
                        their own selfish desires.<br>
                        <br>
                        To prevent the abuse of the Elements, the Heavens sent among the Newborns creatures like unto
                        men, but sensitive to mana like unto elves. Fairies and various pixies were soon born of these
                        and guardians they became, of the Elements and of the Newborns themselves. For ages have tribes
                        like the Tuatha de danann watched over the earth and the powers that bind and sustain it. <br>
