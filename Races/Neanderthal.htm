It�s hair is messy and dirty and often the color of dirt.  Wearing the skins and bones of animals in the fashion of loincloths gives them a dirty and uncivilized look.  They are often followed by a horrendous stench that is easily recognizable.  Their faces are human like yet longer and unintelligent looking.  The male and female look extremely similar.

Suddenly a great plague followed by war tore the kingdom apart and Neanderthals scattered into many tribes.
