                        sectioned body. The largest section is at the back which houses the poison and web spinners. The
                        next section holds vital organs and the final section is the head. Spiders are often covered in
                        tiny hairs and are colored in blacks and browns.<br></td>

                        possess the ability to spin webs strong enough to catch and hold bugs and even small animals.
                        They also produce strong poisons that can kill a human. These insects can control the amount of
                        poison injected so that the prey isnï¿½t quite dead when it starts to feast. Many of the
                        strongest, toughest warriors run screaming from spiders.<br></td>

                        that may have spawned many different animals. At first when an animal died it was left on the
                        ground to rot. After a while the stench overwhelmed the gods and they decided to make flies to
                        eat the dead carcasses. The flies did so well at eating the dead that they began to feast on the
                        living for lack of food so the gods created spiders. Well you can imagine that the spiders,
                        being so well adapted at killing flies, overwhelmed the planet so the gods created birds to eat
                        the flies. Eventually after many new species and even a few natural disasters were created the
                        gods found a semblance of balance and the world was given more variety.<br></td>
