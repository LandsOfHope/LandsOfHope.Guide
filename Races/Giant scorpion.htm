                            title='Female Picture' align=left>These arachnids differ in size. They are most commonly no
                        bigger than a human adultï¿½s hand; however, there are unconfirmed reports of scorpions much
                        larger. Their bodies are made of two sections. The head houses its many beady eyes, mouthparts,
                        and two pincer arms. The abdomen carries the other six legs and extends into the long tail
                        tipped by the stinger. Giant scorpions can come in various colors, though most are shades of
                        yellow or blue. Males tend to be darker in color than females. All scorpions have a florescent
                        property, allowing them to glow in the dark.<br></td>

                        wastes of golden nothingness. However, underneath the blistering heat and the steaming sand
                        there lives a creature that has adapted well to the harsh climate. The giant scorpion, with its
                        great pincers and deadly stinger, has become one of the most identifiable sights of the eastern
                        wastes and several other desert locations. Normally a scavenger, this scorpion is known to be a
                        vicious hunter when necessary. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The deserts of Myzan offer very little in the way of food to sustain
                        any life. The giant scorpion has made a place in the circle of life as a sand sweeper. An
                        inventive scavenger, the giant scorpion spends most of its day burrowing under the sand in
                        search of cool spots and buried carcasses. It will extend its person cave system for miles under
                        the dunes and wastes in its quest for comfort and sustenance. If it should come across a fallen
                        body, it will inject the carcass with an acid to dissolve the insides so it can feed on the
                        liquid.<br>
                        <br>
                        On certain occasions, when food is scarce, the scorpion will begin to hunt the living. As it
                        makes it way through its own tunnels, it will be mindful of shafts and caverns of foreign
                        origin, in which it will investigate and often times perch itself to lie in wait for an
                        unsuspecting victim - a beetle, sandworm, or even another scorpion. When it ventures to the
                        surface, the giant scorpion must be careful for hungry buzzards and lizards, as well as human
                        hunters, as its stinger is highly prized for its poison and appeal as fine jewelry.<br>
