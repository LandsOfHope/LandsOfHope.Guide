                            align=left>These warriors of the Reaper horde are exactly what they sound like: living
                        skeletons. They carry weapons, be it bows, daggers, swords, clubs, or their own body parts. They
                        are raised from the dead by necromancers as needed. They are rarely kept around after battles.
                        Some actually take on a life of their own. They wander away from the horde during battle seeking
                        mayhem and destruction. <br>

                        The bones of the warriors are not like the legends describe. They are sometimes yellow, white,
                        or even dark grey. Their bodies are proportional to the bodies of the individuals that they were
                        raised from. The larger the body, the more damage. The people know an attack is coming when they
                        see a white mass with weapons marching towards them at a steady pace, and their hails are
                        unanswered.<br>

                        Reapers go on attack. In wars, the Reapers send these and Zombies out first as fodder, later
                        sending out Vampires and more powerful creatures. The Skeleton Warriors are not agile, nor
                        swift, nor special in any way, other than the fact that they can take quite a beating and keep
                        going, sometimes using their own legs, arms, or other body parts as weapons. They are quite
                        ruthless. They are virtually impossible to completely destroy. Severing their heads or burning
                        them completely is the only ways to take down these monsters.<br></td>

                        between whose corpses they use to create them. They have served as key creatures in victories in
                        battles that would have been lost otherwise. Skeleton Warriors have been known to have been
                        raised from the long since dead human, elf, and other humanoid bodies. They have been
                        slaughtered, raised, and slaughtered again in battles. They are, have been, and always will be
