The ships are specters that appear out of a peculiar fog that settles around them as they move.  Tattered sails flapping in no wind and a �skull and crossbones� atop the mast are images that every mariner fears.  Undead Pirates are the rotting corpses of dead pirates.  Strangely, ranks are still held on an undead ship and the captain is the most elaborately dressed crew member.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Corpses don�t always die in the land of Myzan.  Sometimes they walk, sometimes fight, and sometimes even sail.  Undead Pirates are the disease ridden corpses of dead �sea dogs�.  Many battles have raged in the seas and many have died, only to rise once again to raid along the coasts of Myzan.  Fear flows before them as they sail the seas and death fills their sails.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>�Aarrgh! Ye scurvy dogs!  Sit ye down and grab ye a pint.  I be about ta tell ye a terrible tale of the dead and� the undead.  It all started on a clear summers night.  The stars were a shinin� and the moon was big �n full.  We whar sailin� t� Safe Harbor when a unearthly fog rolled in.  We was a�feared cuz th� wind died in our sails an� we was dead in the water.  Suddn�ly we heard an� eerie creakin� that came from the fog.  We all watched in horror as a ghost ship appeered.  Cann�ns �xploded before we could do anythin�!  The evil terrers boarded our ship an many of �r bravest jump�d ship.  Others fought abut try�s we might, they took our ship and threw us overboard!  It was them ghost pirates I tell ye!  �N I were the only�n to survive��<br>
