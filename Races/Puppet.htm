Their bodies are wooden and each joint is actually two metal rings looped together.  Tiny clothing is often made for them and can range from simple to luxurious.  Since the puppets arenï¿½t always alive few actually appreciate the clothing that they are given.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Often the citizens of Myzan long for entertainment in their boring lives.  Puppets were created to alleviate that boredom.  These small man made creatures have strings that extend from all of their appendages.  These strings can be manipulated to move the puppet around.  Many of the greatest puppeteers can make the puppet walk and talk and even dance.  Often lonely, and slightly mad, adventurers will take on a puppet as a companion in their travels though, they do not fight well.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Though many forms of puppets were rudimentarily built by children, the first real puppets were made by a man named Augustus the Great.  He fashioned the finest puppets in all of Myzan.  As he traveled about making puppets for nobility and poor alike, rumors began to spread that he was also a mage.  Some of his richer clients seemed to pay him incredible prices for his puppets which led some to believe that Augustus had enchanted them.  Rumors led to fear, fear led to panic, and soon the whole country was hunting for Augustus.  He was found in his secluded workshop in the mountains.  They burnt the shop and everything inside.  As with all geniuses, Augustus the Great was only truly appreciated, and cleared of his charges, after his tragic death.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>DISGUISE</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #66ff66'>MYSTICAL MAGIC</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>MYSTICAL RESISTANCE</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>STEALTH</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Unknown</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
