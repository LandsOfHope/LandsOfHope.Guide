Very little distinguishes the males and females apart, leading some demonologists to believe the whole species is neither one. The truth is there are male and female Whelp demons, the only outward sign of this is the hair color.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The whelp is the lowliest denizen of the demonic plane. Picked on, taunted and teased, they are lowly slaves even there. This of course they accept as their lot, but if given the chance to unleash their centuries, their eons of torment, the whelp is a deadly thing to face.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Very little is known about the whelps of the demonic plane. What is known is that they are the lowest caste of demons, even looked down on by the passive Hellwardens. It is unknown what crime the species committed long ago, but any that has seen an enraged Whelp in a frenzy quickly understand why they are bound and gagged most of the time unless performing their duties.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Whelp Demon</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
