Most of them exhibits physical attributes of what Scholars in Myzan believed as an Ancient Spirit Beast. Varying in size, Feralkins range from two feet to seven feet. They have muscular and well-honed bodies that are mostly covered by hair. They are usually upright in standing and walking but when they run, they use all four of their limbs. The feet and hands have retractable claws that they both use for attacking or defending. They can pass for a human if they wear a heavy hooded cloak. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Feralkins are, in general, feared by most humanoid races. This maybe due to the fact that they can be unpredictable. They can be the most loyal ally, cunning and sly traitor or an avenging enemy. Most Feralkins are quite friendly and carefree. They will go about their business, not minding what the other races think of them. They take this fear as an advantage. That is, other races will think twice before crossing them. It is also a well-known fact that in their veins, lie a sleeping spirit of hate towards humanoid races. Feralkins try to supress this wild rage within them. But once awaken, through persecution or pain, they will go in a rampage of tainting others with their curse. That is, if they haven`t killed them first. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Nobody knows where the first Feralkin originated. Many Scholars believed that a wild Spirit Beast fell in love with an elf maiden. The Beast took a physical body but its appearance was so monstrous that the elves attacked when it approached their glen. The Beast fled, full of rage and hate upon the elves. In its flight, it came upon a group a humans. The unlucky and helpless group received the brunt of the Beast`s wildness and anger as it unleashed itself upon them. Only the arrival of the elves who came to hunt the beast down saved them from certain death. After several days, those whom the Beast has touched, found themselves beginning to transform. They then realized that they may have escaped death but not from being tainted by the Beast`s poison. The poison that is transforming, not only their appearance but also their spirit and soul.They were then both feared and pitied. In order to avoid chaos, they left and tried to lead a normal life away from their original home. There were those who fell into kinship with them and sought to be tainted willingly. They started to spread different stories of where they came from. They were accepted with apprehension in most places in Myzan. But there are also other places, where they were hunted, persecuted or outcasted. This resulted to the awakening of the Spirit Beast`s rage and hate within them, driving them to seek revenge by forcibly tainting other humanoid races. <br>
