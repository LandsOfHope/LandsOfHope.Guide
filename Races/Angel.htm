When they appear before the eyes of a mortal, they take the form of a beautiful woman robed in the purest white.  Their skin radiates light of many colors, usually a color that identifies with their element.  They may appear with or without wings - the more powerful of their kind have three pairs. All Angels have at least two sets of graceful arms, from which each hand often carries a blessing for those might lay eyes on its unmatched, celestial beauty.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Emissaries of holiness, Angels are the spiritual wardens of Myzan.  As children of the heavens, Angels possess great power and wisdom.  They choose to watch and guide the inhabitants of Myzan, refusing to interfere in the affairs of lesser beings as much as possible while still providing a guiding light.  Throughout the land are shrines of reverence to the Angels and their chosen elements, sanctuaries made by men and elves to show their respects and abided in as earthly dwellings by the Angels.  It is considered a great honor for a devout worshiper to experience a theophony inside the halls of an Angel�s shrine.  To have seen an Angel often means tremendous good fortune.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Long before time, the Angels were born.  They called themselves the Aynor, born of a god and the stars.  They fashioned a portion of the virgin world and called it Myzor.  It was a land of great promise and fertility.  Indeed, the Heavens found much pleasure in the work of the Aynor.<br>
<br>
Then the Heavens gave birth to the Newborns, and the Aynor bid the Heavens to place their siblings in the land that they had made.  So it was that Myzor was filled with new life � men and elves, dwarves and orcs, creeping things and beasts, even devils and ferals.  And the Newborns thrived; they grew culture and languages among themselves and took pleasure in the land that their elder sisters had made with such love and care.  The land of Myzor became a home for the Newborns and a retreat for the Aynor.  The new tongues of men and elves deemed the land Myzan and established kings and rulers, and there was peace in the land and joy in the hearts of all creation.  The Newborns called their sisters Angels and marveled at their beauty and wisdom, and they worshipped them among the heavens.  <br>
<br>
Yet cold grew the hearts of some men and some elves, some dwarves and some orcs, some creeping things and some beasts, even some devils and some ferals.  Envy in their hearts turned to jealousy, and jealousy soon turned to hate.  They rose up and made war with the Angels, who knew nothing of evil things and felt their wisdom abandon them.  The Heavens then declared Myzan the land of the lesser and made the Angels watchers, yet guardians, of the land and their brothers.  Now, the Angels are separated from their beloved siblings and must painfully watch over their brooding hearts until the day should come that the Heavens would take true vengeance for the corrupted of Myzan. <br>
