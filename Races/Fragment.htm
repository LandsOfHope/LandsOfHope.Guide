                        they look like small boulders of crystal, glowing with elemental power. They range from one to
                        ten feet in diameter. The auras around them have been speculated to denote their genders, but no
                        one has done an extensive study on the subject.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Fragments were discovered in the magical community a century ago by
                        a professor at the Myzan Academy of Magi-Science. They are believed to be the young form of the
                        elementals, being made of a similar crystalline material. No one knows for sure why they appear
                        on Myzan before maturing, but some suspect the young elementals need to collect gems as
                        nourishment.<br>
                        <br>
                        There is another theory that they might be sentient pieces from the world known as Saloa, if
                        true, this could mean Saloa was destroyed and not just have slipped into the veil.<br>
