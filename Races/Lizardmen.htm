                        lizard, Lizardmen can be very intimidating sights. Their bodies are usually covered with scales
                        colored in greens and browns. Lizardmen have a long snout and small eyes that exude
                        intelligence. The bite of a lizrdman is slightly toxic.<br></td>

                        fear. These creatures seem to be built to cause mayhem but in reality they are a peaceful race.
                        Lizardmen are the strange mixture of man and lizard. This odd combination could only have
                        happened as a result of magic. <br>

                        As a race, lizardmen seem to be cultured and intelligent. They take to making their own clothes,
                        jewelry, and homes. Lizardmen even create art, literature and music. The common misconception
                        with these creatures is language and speech. Humans often believe them to be unintelligent
                        because they cannot use common speech very well. This view is very wrong as Lizardmen have their
                        own language yet can learn others. <br>

                        hidden by many years of tradition passed through the generations. Lizardmen have always kept
                        careful record and have been even more careful not to tell others how they began. Some snippets
                        of the story have been discovered but no real evidence of the truth exists. Only one real piece
                        of tradition has been uncovered by a very unlucky story teller. He writes in his journal that he
                        had discovered the history of the lizardmen by means of a very clever disguise. Unfortunately,
                        before he was able to translate this history he was assassinated and the manuscript was
                        stolen.<br></td>
