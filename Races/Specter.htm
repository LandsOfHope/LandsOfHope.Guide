                        skeletal remains of a former living being. The eyeballs may remain in the sockets as deeply
                        glowing disks, but most other organs would have either fallen out or decayed away. Specters may
                        on occasion don armor; however, the only �clothing� uniformly worn by these creatures are the
                        rotten scraps of flesh that once hid their bleaching bones.<br></td>

                        alongside other skeletal warriors as the brunt of the Undead�s armed forces. What they lack in
                        strength, Specters easily make up for in endurance and sheer numbers. They are easily revived
                        from old graves and are often recast as other variations of skeletal creatures by wielders of
                        necromancy. In battle, it is almost necessary to entirely destroy � obliterate � a Specter to
                        ensure that it won�t be resurrected or reformed.<br></td>

                        dead. Because lifeless bone in weak and frail, old graves were indeed perfect sources for
                        minions. The resilience and single-mindedness of skeletal warriors made such armies equal parts
                        frightening and deadly, and the added quality of skeletals being more recyclable than simply
                        expendable zombies made such armies more desirable for the First. Unfortunately, the
                        Necromancers were yet again twisted by their greedy search for dark powers and immortality. Some
                        of the Necromancers guilty of raising the dead found themselves becoming like the walking
                        skeletons they prized so much. These were the first Specters.<br></td>
