                            title='Female Picture' align=left>Shrouded in a soft glow of mana induced light, Sylphs
                        appear to those who have lost their way upon the bleak drifts of Myzan�s vast glaciers. They are
                        like tiny human children with thin, rounded wings to flutter about with. Their voices are small
                        and squeaky, and it is unknown if they speak any understandable language, though they seem to
                        understand each other well enough. The glow from their bodies stems from their skin, delicate
                        and luminous with various blues and pinks. The mystical light serves as a beacon through the
                        driving snows of the cold regions or the dense fogs of the bordering lowlands.<br></td>

                        Sylphs can often be found guiding caravans through the snows and mists that fall over the
                        region, from Coldbreeze to Frostvale. They are a cheery people, forever singing of the
                        brilliance of the snow-covered north and happily revealing the way through the snow for those
                        that would be lost otherwise. Ever proud of their chosen task to watch over the Elements of the
                        cold, these child-like fairies are always willing to lend aid with a smile and a song.<br></td>

                        worshiped by the inhabitants of Myzan as deities themselves. The Sylphs have inspired such
                        worship from various tribes and clans among the ice trolls and other sentient creatures of the
                        deep cold and the glaciers. Known for their mastery over cold magics, Sylphs are believed to be
                        the chosen guardians of the ice Elemental and its powers and are thus highly respected by those
                        of the northern region who believe this to be so, even to the point of worship by the most
                        devout. Sylphs are also recognized by Elementalists, Mages, and other mana wielders as makers of
                        fine powder and potent rings blessed with rare imprints. The Ice Mages Guild wears a stylized
                        Sylph upon its crest in homage to the glowing fairy�s blessing from the Heavens.<br></td>
