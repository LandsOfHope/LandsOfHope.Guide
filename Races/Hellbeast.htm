Parts of their bodies are formed by lava while the rest is lined by the ashen rock that makes up the ground around the lava pools of their birthplace. As they walk, they set fire to any living thing they come in contact with. They age as their bodies cool, slowly shrinking in size and eventually becoming nothing more than piles of volcanic ash that have been tracked from their spawning pool. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Born of the fury and rage under the surface of lava in northeast Knotwood Valley, a Hellbeast is a walking mass of lava and rock shaped like a massive human being. Each Hellbeast lives for one thing: destruction. They have little to no brain. Their sole purpose is to seek out anything and everything they can and destroy it. Seeing one of the creatures frightens even the most battle-hardened warrior. Most soldiers cannot stand to fight them, for with the heat comes an incredibly strong scent. Powerful mages can even summon these creatures to do their bidding. Sometimes, disaster strikes and the mage cannot control them. The Hellbeast escapes control and goes on a rampage that destroys almost anything in its path until it runs out of fuel, so to speak. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Over the ages, Hellbeasts have been used by almost anyone, from amateur mages to wizened wizards. They have occasionally spawned at random. They can also be found in the lava itself. Some have even been living for centuries, having never ventured from the heat and lava, therefore never perished. Beyond this, few have lived to tell about their encounters with Hellbeasts. If they have, they are frequently unwilling to speak of them because of the nightmares the memories will cause.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>FIRE MAGIC</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/395.gif'></td><td><b>flesh</b><br>Spawn Chance: 15%</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/bds.gif'></td><td><b>rotting arm</b><br>Spawn Chance: 2%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Fire Mage</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Flamecaller</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Mystic</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
