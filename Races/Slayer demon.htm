                        centuries. While most have not seen one in just as many years, they are still talked about.
                        Though recently, two apparent subspecies have been showing up to terrorize Myzan, the Devourer
                        of Might and the Devourer of Magic. Neither subspecies seems to be natural, and both types claim
                        to serve a master named Nioxis.<br></td>
