                            align=left>Rough, green hued skin covers a very muscular humanoid body. Orcs have tusks that
                        jut out of their bottom jaw causing an extreme overbite. This overbite gives the orcs an
                        unintelligent leering grin. The dead give away of an orc lord is the roughly made crown that
                        they wear. Though their speech is often a broken and primitive form of the common tongue, their
                        eyes belie an unlikely intelligence.<br></td>

                        These descriptions are the often correct stereotypes of a very complex culture. Their history is
                        deep and long. Clan social structure is often misunderstood by other races. Many find it
                        difficult to believe that honor is very important to an orc.<br>

                        When an orc warrior reaches the age of 35 years they become a lord and elder in the clans. Since
                        few orcs reach this age there are a few lords. Only the best and brightest reach this rank.
                        Skilled warriors, or those who are lucky enough to survive, are given gifts of their rank
                        including a simple crown which marks their position. Land and money are also gifted. Orc lords
                        usually take one of two paths. The long path includes using their power to avoid direct combat
                        for the rest of their days. The short path includes the lord leading his clan in battle at every
                        opportunity.<br>

                        weak bodies. An ancient text reveals the existence of a cult of a cruel god that feeds of
                        self-hate. It is said that the worship of this god changed a large group of his followers. As
                        they sank deeper and deeper into this worship their skin began to change into putrid colors,
                        they grew tusks and became increasingly hideous. Though these changes made them outcasts, their
                        bodies became stronger and they developed immunities to some of the diseases that killed many
                        humans. Although they loved their new changes, they became social outcasts from civilized
                        cities. Humans began to hunt this cult until a wise king saw that the orcs were beginning to
                        become stronger than Myzanï¿½s armies could handle. The constant battle turned this race into
                        strict warriors. Although tension still exists between the people, the bridges of peace are
                        beginning to be built.<br></td>
