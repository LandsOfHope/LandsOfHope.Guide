<table class='barCell2' style='width: 415; cursor: none' cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td colspan='2' valign=top><table class='weakcell' width='100%' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td colspan='2'><b>Classification: Beast</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>Appearance</b><br><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/r/gt1.gif' title='Male Picture' align=left><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/r/gt2.gif' title='Female Picture' align=left>Giant Rabbits looks very much the same as their original small and cute predecessors, except for the gigantic size. Newly born giant rabbits are about the size of a full-grown sheep, growing upto 8-10 meters of adult height. They have short,fluffy tails on their backside and long ears that are usually flopped down to the ground, dragging anything on its path. Their top-coats have different colors such as brown, white, gray, sometimes mottled with red patches and black. The undersides are either white or light gray. They have strong back legs and can run fast and leap far. Their furs are more softer than their original forefathers and can quite reach a high-price in the markets of Myzan.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Rabbits are primarily, gentle animals that usually live in woodlands, under trees. That is, until alchemy came along and changed a `few` of them into giants. Giant rabbits can now be found multiplying happily in rolling, huge hills and valleys of Myzan. Taking to their small origins, these amazing animals are quite sociable and friendly. Still, there are many races in Myzan who would prefer to either avoid where they live or eliminate this race altogether. For despite their size, giant rabbits retained most of their original characteristics. They are quite easy to startle and they defend themselves by quickly fleeing what they think as danger, toppling or squashing anything in their path. Or by remaining motionless and act dead for days and weeks, blocking paths and roads in the process. A frightened regular-sized rabbit may thump with its back legs or flatten itself against the ground. One can imagine how a giant rabbit will do the same when agitated. Giant rabbits can be a great resource of fur and meat. They can also be used as cuddly, living furniture in the house but due to their big body size and small brains, it is a risk keeping one as a pet.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The alchemist Ramos Ramoo has always been so concious about his height. Though not really that vertically challenged, he still believed he could add a bit more centimeters for a more manly, noble stature. He thinks this will impress a lot of female alchemists. He then started to experiment with different substances and ingredients for mixtures that will encourage growth. He first tested these mixtures on plants before proceeding to small animals. He then found that rabbits are more reactive to the mixtures. In fact, they were quite sensitive to them. He continued to work with rabbits, believing that this will hasten the fruits of his experiments. Though he came near creating the ultimate growing elixir, the rabbits have grown too huge and gigantic to be contained. They started to run rampant in the village that the villagers of Springlade begged him to stop. At first, the alchemist would not hear their plea until a pretty girl commented on how his height is actually perfect. He then agreed to stop the experiments, figuring out that the elixir cannot really work on humanoids. He then sent the giant rabbits away from the village before someone comes up with the idea that he should make an elixir to return them back to normal size.<br>
