                        features in the face but also the horns and teeth of dragons. They are able to fly with the
                        wings on their back. Clan members are very muscular and agile. Their skin is often shades of red
                        but can also be any other color. Color is often an indicator of their lineage and some colors
                        refuse to breed with others. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Many ancient traditions claim that the old dragons were able to
                        magically change form. These intelligent and capable dragons would often take the form of
                        humans. Some would even fall in love with them resulting in a crossbred offspring. This is the
                        beginning of the Dragon Clan. Of ten the friends and family of the crossbred child would
                        excommunicate the mother and child from civilization. Mother and child would search for the
                        dragon father and the dragons would gather their offspring into colonies. These colonies were
                        where the dragons would teach the Dragon Clan many things. Today the old knowledge of the wyrms
                        lives and thrives even when the old dragons are long gone.<br></td>
