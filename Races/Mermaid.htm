                        below the surface. Scholars argue about whether the young are born live or hatched<br>
                        from eggs. The females are slim and bedeck themselves with jewels of the seas.<br>
                        The males have a bulkier body but still have the grace and beauty of the merfolk.<br>

                        predate the<br>
                        humans of Myzan. Many myths and legends exist describing how they were once<br>
                        human. In one such legend it is said a tragedy caused a woman to toss <br>
                        herself into the sea but her beauty was so great that the gods decided to change<br>
                        her rather than let her die. In times of danger for Myzan the rulers of the seas have<br>
                        been known to raise the merfolk to war. Vast battles on the seas were affected by<br>
                        the cunning and skill of the merfolk. It has been years since the mermaids have<br>
                        felt the need to join in with the humans. Today many people now believe them to be<br>
                        only a myth though the fishers of Myzan know the truth.<br></td>
