                            title='Female Picture' align=left>Necrytes are horrid creatures that were at one time some
                        other race. After being afflicted with some sort of necromantic spell or curse, its living body
                        begins to rapidly decline and decay; the effects can be likened to advanced stages of leprosy,
                        but affecting the entire body. Often the curse is applied through some sort of attack, usually
                        by a Nightstalker or Feralkin. Due to the intense violence of such an attack, the body or, more
                        appropriately, corpse would be mangled, twisted, ravaged, or otherwise beaten, battered, and
                        bitten even at times beyond recognition. Though some necrytes chose to remain in this condition,
                        many prefer to allow the curse to run its course and soon adapt the final form associated with
                        the bind placed on them. Often, this stage in an Undead�s development is rather short lived and
                        unmemorable; however, it is in this stage that the taste for blood and flesh is usually
                        acquired. <br></td>

                        transitional phase that many Reapers endure before taking on their true forms. Unlike many
                        undead creatures, necrytes are not soulless, wandering corpses, but are rather bodies fighting
                        an inevitable fall to some necromantic curse in an effort to preserve the existence of the soul
                        it hosts. It is for this reason that there are several Undead races that may stem of the necryte
                        that aren�t actually undead at all, such as the feral races, demons, and apparitions. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>From the very beginnings of the Reaper horde, necrytes have played
                        an important part in the rise and terror of the dark alliance. The fallen Followers who
                        discovered the powers of necromancy turned themselves into necrytes in order to escape death and
                        live indefinitely with great strength and power at their disposal. However, these first necrytes
                        were unstable, and eventually they wasted away. <br>
                        <br>
                        Those that came soon after further perfected the dark arts and raised an army of undead
                        creatures to serve them. At the core of this army was the goal to expand and multiply, and so
                        the passage of evil curses and spells was granted to it. New recruits were made out of the very
                        people who had once scorned and degraded the Followers, now known as Reapers. Before being
                        defeated in the Great War of the First, the Reapers could count on turning at least three
                        necrytes for every one fallen undead.<br>
