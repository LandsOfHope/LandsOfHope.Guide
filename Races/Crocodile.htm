                        squat legs. Long tooth filled snouts and intelligent beady eyes are the major features of the
                        crocodile`s head while on the other end a tail longer than its body trails behind. Crocodiles
                        are capable of running incredible speeds over a short distance which makes them twice as
                        dangerous in the cramped quarters of most dungeons.<br></td>
