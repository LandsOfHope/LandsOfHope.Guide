They are perverted forms of their former selves.  With sunken cheeks; hollow, blood-shoot eyes; graying hair; and often paling or rotten flesh, Ghasts are indeed a ghastly sight to behold.  With a solid body, the Ghast are able to wield heavy weaponry and armor, making their presence even more fearsome and intimidating than ever before.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Normally thought of as a metaphysical being, the Ghast are now appearing in larger numbers as physical manifestations.  Believed to be much more powerful than their ghost-like counterparts, the new breed of Ghast is the result of a new, more powerful necromantic curse.  It could be that the Reapers are looking to fill their ranks with stronger soldiers capable of leading not only a massive slaughter, but an organized regiment.  It is rumored that the Reapers are reorganizing kingdom wide, and if this true, the Reapers could pose a bigger threat to the ambitions of the Society and claims of the Exiles.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The remnant of the first Reaper horde has made itself known.  The surviving necromancers of old have passed their dark arts on to a new generation, one that has taken it upon itself to flood the lands of Myzan with blood.  With new spells, new warriors, and a new found thirst for carnage, the Reaper horde is now making its advance upon Myzan.  Leading the charge as before are the Ghast, now a race one with this world, a race determined to destroy it.<br></td></tr><br><tr><Td colspan=2><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=5 style='height: 15'><center><b>Tier 4 Race Evolution at Level 800</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakercell'><td style="cursor: hand" onclick="window.location.replace('beastiary.asp?r=Fury')"><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/r/hgm.gif'><br><b>Fury</b></td></tr></table></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Unknown</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
