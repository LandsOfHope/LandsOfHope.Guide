                            title='Female Picture' align=left>Long bodied reptiles, alligators have incredibly strong
                        short legs. They may only be 12-15 inches high but they can reach lengths of 12 -20 feet!
                        Alligators have a wide flat head that is completely filled with teeth. A long and dangerously
                        strong tail is a threat to any who think that wrestling an alligator would be fun. Eyes that sit
                        upon the top of the head allow the beasts to keep their body below water while watching above
                        it. Large scales cover the body that are usually colored in shades of green.<br></td>

                        incredibly strong and dangerous animal. Alligators are terribly fast and deadly beasts. They
                        hunt from the water waiting for an unsuspecting victim to bend down to take a drink. When the
                        beast�s next lunch is most vulnerable the alligator bursts from the water and grabs the victim.
                        When the alligator starts to roll the victim will have already sustained incredible injury and
                        most likely is all ready dead. The skin of an alligator is highly coveted by many of Myzan`s
                        elite. Many of the most secure bags available are made of alligator skin.<br></td>
