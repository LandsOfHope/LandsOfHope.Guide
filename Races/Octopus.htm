                        body. Each tentacle has suction cups on one side which are used to grip and hold things. Most
                        octopi choose to crawl along the bottom of the ocean using the tentacles to pull them along. A
                        large pair of eyes bulge from the front of their heads and give them a look of evil and
                        cunning.<br></td>

                        Among the oddest and most interesting is the octopus. An octopus is a large and very strange
                        animal. It has eight long tentacles covered with suction cups on one side. These tentacles are
                        supported by a large blob of a body that houses all of the organs. Out of the water they are
                        just disgusting and useless but underwater they are a fearsome enemy. Many adventurers have
                        perished when an angry octopus has latched onto their head and neck.<br></td>

                        that they are a myth of the sea. The few mariners that have lived through an encounter with an
                        octopus tell that they are the evil spawn of the gods of the seas. Such unusual and ugly
                        creatures can only be bad portents for those who sail.<br></td>
