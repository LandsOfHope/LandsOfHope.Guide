                        of colors. Long tentacles stream from its body and dangle in the water as it drifts in the
                        water. The jellyfish uses these tentacles to sting and catch its prey. Jellyfish can be so small
                        that they can barely be seen and also as large as three feet across with tentacles that trail
                        over nine feet in length. Some species of jellyfish will glow in the dark. Certain jellyfish
                        have stingers on its tentacles that have a venom so powerful that it can kill a human.<br></td>
