                        have no true form, as they are like the ether itself. On our plane of existence, they tend to
                        take the form of a living bundle of coherent energy, a malevolent looking face shifting to and
                        from around its form. They can be as small as a pixie, or expand their bodies to appear as tall
                        as humans, but they tend to prefer a size roughly that of a halflings. They appear to be able to
                        change their color, but it is not known what this means.<br></td>

                        not truly natural creatures of Myzan. While non are sure where they come from exactly, they have
                        been known to serve shamans who know how to perform the ritual of summoning. They are said to
                        whisper archaic secrets and inspire the shamans who summon them, and to devour the very life
                        essence of their shaman`s enemies. If you see a Lhianan-Shee without a shaman, there is no doubt
                        it is up to no good and is best given a wide path and avoided or else fall victim to their
                        hunger for life energy.<br></td>

                        our plane, but it is known that it predates most written histories in the form of drawings on
                        walls of sites sacred to shamans. Many have tried to understand the "language" of the
                        Lhiannan-Shee, a language consisting of the changing colors of their bodies, but non have
                        succeeded in understanding them. It was first speculated that they came from the very same plane
                        as mystical magic energy, but it has since been discounted as they abhor mystical energies and
                        prefer natural settings. The most infamous mention of the Lhiannan-Shee is the story of a party
                        former King Blackcrest threw. A nobleman thought it would be funny to have one of the shamans in
                        his employ summon one to slip into the party and tie peoples boot laces together, suffice it to
                        say, the mischievous little thing tied the King`s own bootlaces together, and the noble was
                        never heard from again.<br></td>
