                        stronger, fit, faster, thinner, and more powerful. They exert a command presence that is rarely
                        questioned. Their hair is generally in a fancier style than their underlings. They are among

                        superior attitude, manner, and are the most powerful, mostly from age since they became undead.
                        Rank in the Vampire society is frequently determined by contests of strength and mental prowess.
                        The loser does not live. Vampire Lords have risen to the highest echelon of the groups. They
                        make the decisions where to attack, where to feed, and where the other vampires will rest, even.
                        The fights are very vicious when someone challenges a pack leader. No holds are barred.
                        Everything goes. There is no �cheap� attack when this happens. It is a fight to the second
