                            title='Female Picture' align=left>At first glance, the carnivorous ivy appears as little
                        more than a large bush with colorful leaves. However, wander too close and you will quickly
                        discover that it is far more than that.<br>
                        <br>
                        When awaiting food, the ivy remains in a resting state, its sensitive root system detecting the
                        vibrations of potential food as it draws near. Before an attack, the carnivorous ivy resembles a
                        rhododendron bush, with thick, fleshy leaves that range from a dull gold color to a deep,
                        reddish-purple. The stems can vary in color from sap green to brown. If one looks closely, one
                        will notice what appears to be a huge, closed bud towards the center of the bush. Also, beneath
                        the covering leaves, one can barely make out coiled tendrils that laying upon the ground, a
                        layer of soil pulled over them for camouflage.<br>
                        <br>
                        As a rodent (or unwary traveler!) wanders near, the tendrils whip out with a speed that boggles
                        the mind and wrap about their victim. It is then that the central bud opens, revealing a maw
                        much like a giant venus flytrap, and two nodules on the sides of the bud open to reveal
                        primitive eyes. The tendrils pull their squealing and struggling prey towards the �mouth� where
                        it is trapped and digested over the course of several days.<br>

                        rhododendron and azaleas, which it resembles when in its resting state. Being a shade loving
                        plant, it usually grows best under the protection of a forest canopy. However, a few smaller,
                        hardier species have developed which can withstand full sunlight.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>There has been much speculation among naturalists as to the origin
                        of the carnivorous ivy. In fact, the speed with which the plant moves combined with the odd,
                        eye-like organs located on the central bud have led many to consider that the ivy either may not
                        be a plant at all or is a strange hybrid of plant and animal. Perhaps it is a few steps ahead of
                        the slime mold, another animal-plant marvel. But, then�what evolutionary steps lie in between
                        the two?<br>
                        <br>
                        Another sect of naturalists believe that the carnivorous plant is the product of magical
                        tampering by bored mages or, even, the occasional mad druid who has attempted to breed a new
                        form of plant guardian for his grove.<br>
