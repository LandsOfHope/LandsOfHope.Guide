A straight stalk, usually a bright color, protrudes from underneath the cap.  This fungus shuffles and jumps with the stalk and has no arms or legs.  One of the most mesmerizing features of a Red Cap is the eyes which seem to glow with an odd intelligence.  Colors are often bright and noticeable which serves as a warning to the unwary.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Small but potent, Red Caps are �awakened� mushrooms.  Seemingly simple and barbaric, the Red Caps have an extremely complex communication system.  They also have an odd order to their society.  The ranks are determined by the amount of spots on their caps.  Each Red Cap matures after 20 days and a ceremony is held, often for hundreds of young.  The �Counting� is the turning point in a Red Cap�s life.  The tribe counts the spots of the young and places them in a rank.  In this way a young Red Cap can become chief of a tribe in a day and there are surprisingly few fights over ranks.  Any seasoned warrior knows to be wary around Red Cap territory.  These creature�s potent magic and poisons can fell the toughest adventurers.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Red Caps come from the deepest forests of Myzan.  Tales of those forests are few and far between.  Some say that the way to tell you are in Red Cap territory is that you start to hallucinate.  Shapes and colors start to cloud your view and noises of great beasts ring in your ears.  The spores of the Red Cap very poisonous to humanoids and cause these visions.  Some Shamans have used Red Cap spore for their rituals.  An odd writing from a Reaper shaman crept up into the civilized lands.  <br>
<br>
�The great ones tell us that blood spores will give us power to channel a portal to other lands.  This I have tried but failed.  Incredible visions came to my mind`s eye of battles.  I can only handle a little at a time, even in my undead form.  These visions trap the mind and make it utterly useless.  I doubt I will use it much longer��<br>
<br>
Even the reapers fear the power of the Red Caps� it would be unwise to not do so.<br>
