                        blend in well with the territory they dwell in. Many an explorer has been surprised by a goblin
                        jumping out of shrubbery and attacking them. Goblins have very long fingers and feet which makes
                        them very agile in picking pockets and fleeing. Most people avoid them like the plague when they
                        visit the cities and towns. With long pointed ears and wide tooth filled mouths, a goblin has a
