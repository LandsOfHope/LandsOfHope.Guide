                        Cerberus is a large animal that can stand as tall as a small pack horse and has a smooth, fine
                        fur that comes in the unusual colors of red and purples. Although it has the body and legs of a
                        dog, it is a striking beast because it also has three long necks that end in three vicious
                        heads. Each head thinks and acts on its own but they all<br>
                        coordinate their actions making the Cerberus an extremely dangerous beast to fight. Large sharp
                        teeth sprout from each mouth allowing the beast to bite at will from multiple directions.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The Cerberus is a beast that dwells in the realm of Riverscape where
                        it can be found roaming the dirt and sand areas of Myzan. Solitary hunters, the Cerberus prey on
                        other animals and are well known for their savage attacks. Fighting a Cerberus can be a tricky
                        situation and one needs to be sharp and quick to survive. Quite often, a survivor of a fight
                        with a Cerberus will need to find a healer to counter strange diseases the bites will cause.<br>

                        The Cerberus has long been a terror for humankind and most wise people avoid the areas where
                        this animal makes its home. Legend has it that a pack of hunting dogs were caught in a battle
                        between magic users and a spell caused them to meld together into one<br>
                        animal. However it happened, the Cerberus is another of the unusual beasts found on Myzan.<br>
