                        with webbed feet. These feet enable the ducks to swim through water with ease. A long neck
                        sprouts from the body and ends with a small head, from which protrudes an orange bill. A duck�s
                        body is covered with feathers that vary in color but are most often white and shades of

                        originated from an ancient contest of will, stamina and patience. At the time it was called
                        �Gro�n� it is now known as �duck herding�. The object of the contest is to line the ducks
                        between two logs. Two competitors face off at a time gathering, sorting and lining up the ducks.
                        The flighty and easily distracted ducks often do not stay lined up for long so the competitors
                        must move quickly to herd his or her ducks. Great players are able to multitask mentally and
                        physically and know the ducks and their behavior very well.<br></td>
