                        of plants. While they look humenoid, the bean sidhe`s physical body is actually that of a small
                        bean, like a snow pea pod. Through shamanistic coaxing, the spirits of these plants can be
                        released. They have a need to absorb mystical energy while in spirit form to both nurish and
                        sustain themselves outside their bean pod.<br></td>

                        who talked to his food, untill one day his food talked back. In his bowl of beans he claimed to
                        hear the dieing voice of a spirit asking him to help its people. Taking a fresh bean pod and
                        performing a simple ritual released the dormant spirit inside. Ever since, shamans have been
                        taught to carry a few pods around incase they ever need a friend in a pinch.<br></td>
