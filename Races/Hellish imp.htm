Usually seen in packs, it is said a pack of the imps rampaged across the realms until the firebelly brandy they had stolen ran out and they lost interest in us. Warlocks find these imps easiest to summon and keep as minions over the other demonics. Their natural talent in summoning up energies from their home plane make them excellent distractions for the warlock to escape.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Despite coming from the demonic lower planes, the hellish imp is somewhat playful. Of course playful to a demon means filling your shoes with burning brimstone, but itï¿½s the thought that counts. So just remember, if you smell sulfur and hear a snicker, best to have on a clean pair of pants.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Their eyes are just glowing embers in a rocky, brimstone like body. They do have leathery wings which are fully functional. Hiding a hellish imp is difficult as the tend to glow from their inner fire, which is quite a literal expression when dealing with them. Communications with them reveal there are males and females, though it is hard to distinguish between them for mortal observers.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Pit Demon</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
