                            align=left>The sight of a Lemurian gliding through the air far above the land is one that
                        few forget. Few races of Myzan have the innate grace of a Lemurian. Tall and lanky with a
                        fragile look to them, the Lemurian appears to be quite delicate in form. With large pointed ears
                        like the Elvan race, they have excellent hearing. Beautiful white feathered wings sprout from
                        their backs allowing them the wonder of flight. A Lemurian has excellent eye sight and can see
                        many miles away while in flight. Two antenna like appendages grow from their foreheads yet no
                        one is really sure if they have a use.<br></td>

                        the Lemurians are not a shy nor withdrawn race they are not one of the better known ones due to
                        the difficulty of reaching their homelands. They are known, however, to be very proud beings who
                        consider honor to be the most important thing in life to achieve.<br></td>

                        he became well known as the best archer ever seen. With his ability to fly and his keen
                        eyesight, D`Shae^an saved many squads of scouting Exiles.<br></td>
