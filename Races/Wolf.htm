Their bodies are low to the ground yet long.  The tail is about a half of the length of the animal itself.  A wolf is a close relation to the dog and has a longer dog face.  Wolf eyes are eerie and strangely colored.  Fur covers the entire body of the wolf except for the pads of the feet and parts of the face.  This fur can be many colors but are most often shades of grey and black.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Wolves are the most jaded animal in the forests of Myzan.  They are often feared as terrible beasts but in reality they are quite affectionate and loving creatures.  Often hunted for their pelts and to �protect� humans, wolves are fierce when cornered.  Wolves are highly protective of their young and their pack.  They have the strength and ability to take down the largest beasts and strongest humanoids.  <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Although many have tried to exterminate the wolf, there are some that are dedicated to protecting and encouraging the growth of the wolf.  The Order of Lupis was founded by a nobleman that was obsessed with the wolf.  He spent many hours studying the packs near his estate.  His notes were those of a madman�<br>
<br>
�The beautiful one, Sha, took control of the pack today.  He struck out at Mek and they battled for hours.  It was delicious!  Mek died in the battle and Sha walked away with a trifle of a wound and leadership of the pack.  I long to run with them and mourn with them as they sit atop the hill near my window, howling for their lost friend��<br>
<br>
The nobleman disappeared a few days after this entry.  Many of his relatives believed he became feralkin.  His dreams may have come true.<br>
