                            title='Female Picture' align=left>An essence is a difficult thing to describe, for it has no
                        true form. As an ethereal being of pure magic, it is more often than not completely invisible,
                        undetected by the mortal senses. However, on those occasions when it deems to show itself, the
                        essence appears as a vaporous, glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. Floating above the ground, it
                        has no legs. However, if you look closely, you can almost make out two arms and maybe a long,
                        featureless face within its misty form.<br>
                        <br>
                        While it has no solid body to speak of, energy seems to caress the essence�s shape, running
                        along its form in waves that eventually rise upwards like flames to flicker and dance, even if
                        there is no wind about. Were you to put your arm through the creature, it is uncertain whether
                        you would feel a fire�s heat, electricity�s sting or nothing more than a cool, wetness as though
                        you passed your hand through fog.<br>

                        well�their essence. By killing an essence, the alchemist can often extract pure magical energy
                        from the being as it dies. This magical energy can then be added to concoctions, giving their
                        wares greater power and longevity. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Essences have been around for as long as Myzan has existed. They are
                        creatures born of the very heart of the world, created from the remnants of the magic that made
                        formed Myzan, itself.<br>
                        <br>
                        When great artisans create their works, there is always a little bit of material left over. A
                        stonemason grinds down a raw gem to create a jewel, and gem dust is left behind. A sculptor
                        carves a statue from wood, leaving chips littering the floor at his feet. It was exactly the
                        same when the gods created Myzan. There was a bit of life magic left over from their initial
                        creation, and these bits became essences.<br>
                        <br>
                        Now, many artists would clean up their work, brushing away leftovers so that their creation is
                        pristine. The gods, however, looked down upon the essences and they smiled. These creatures were
                        not �leftovers� but another form of life to add to the diversity of their creation. The gods sat
                        and watched quietly as the essences stumbled about, at first, wandering aimlessly as they
                        explored the world and stretched their senses. After awhile, the gods moved on to creating other
                        forms of life, leaving the essences to grow into whatever they wished, just as they would leave
                        all the races to their own devises.<br>
                        <br>
                        And, what did the essences do? They grew in power and desire, seeking out sources of magic to
                        add to their own. Oh, they do not gather magic to use as a wizard does. Instead, they seek magic
                        to add to themselves, to consume like the finest of wines. Essences can often be found around
                        ley lines, soaking up the magic in those mystical places, reveling in feeling the power course
                        through their bodies.<br>
