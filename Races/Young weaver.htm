                        are even more difficult to look upon as they have the torso and head of a young child upon the
                        body of a spider. Instead of the dark color of the adult weaver, the young weaver is often a
                        pale lavender or pinkish shade. Standing only three feet tall, the young weaver is a dexterious
                        creature able to jump distances of over ten feet and change<br>
                        directions instantaneously.<br></td>

                        creatures. Born hungry, they run in a path of destruction, mindless mouths searching for food of
                        any kind. Strong, well-armed warriors have been known to fall to these hordes.<br></td>

                        their minions inside the protective walls and can only watch as the hordes destroy their budding
                        crops. Mindless with hunger, the young weavers eat everything in sight, often<br>
                        battling and killing each other for any small portion of food. As their hunger is sated the
                        young weaver`s instincts call them back to the forests the species call home. The few survivors
                        burrow deep in the darkest areas building lairs of their own where they grow to be adults, lay
                        eggs of their own and continue the cycle of the weavers lives.<br>
