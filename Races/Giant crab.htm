Because of its great mass, the giant crab is far more compact in shape than its smaller cousins, lacking long, spindly legs and claws that jut out a great distance from the body. Instead, its legs are shorter with a thicker exoskeleton meant to support its greater weight upon those occasions when it ventures out of its oceanic home.<br>
<br>
Both sexes sport a pair of large pincers on their anterior. For both, they function as a means of grasping and killing prey and as a means of defense. The males also use their claws to  attract a mate, waving them about in a fantastic, jittery crab dance during the fertile season.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Giant Crab Fritters<br>

Every spring, these giant crustaceans migrate and Pontia lies directly in their path. For days, the villages are overrun as great masses of golden-red crabs march like a wave over roads, through crop fields, and often right through people�s homes. Hundreds of gold worth of damage is done each year to property though, thankfully, lives are rarely lost due to the giant crab�s mild disposition.<br>
<br>
The resourceful people of Pontia, rather than bend to anger or depression over this act of nature, have turned it to their advantage. Once the migration begins, the Pontians send out their best hunters to take down crab after crab, bringing in hundreds of pounds of meat�which their mages promptly freeze and ship to the mainland for sale.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>POISON MAGIC</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/i/395.gif'></td><td><b>flesh</b><br>Spawn Chance: 15%</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/i/bds.gif'></td><td><b>rotting arm</b><br>Spawn Chance: 2%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Creature</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
