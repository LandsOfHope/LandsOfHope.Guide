                            align=left>Avalerion are sometimes referred to as lesser phoenixes because of their striking
                        resemblance to their larger cousin. Much like the Phoenix, an Avalerion is a raptor with wings
                        that appear to be on fire; the colors of its feathers are so brilliant, the reds and oranges
                        that paint its body appear to flicker like flames as it soars through the sunlight high in the
                        sky. Its beak is sharp and powerful, and its talons are strong, quick, and perfect for precision
                        hunting. Overall, an Avalerion will grow to be roughly twice the size of an average human male.
                        Its wings can measure 12 feet or so end-to-end.<br>
                        <br>
                        Though typically more aggressive than the Phoenix, Avalerion are still quite gentle creatures
                        when not aggravated or on the hunt. Not normally keen on being tamed, an Avalerion may of its
                        own accord lend itself to someone in need. Otherwise, it is best not to tempt one of these great
                        fowl to loose its cool. <br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>These magnificent raptors are closely related to the larger,
                        flame-feathered Phoenix. The Avalerion are great birds that command the skies. They are not
                        often seen about Myzan, but they are more common than the Phoenix. They prefer to hunt alone in
                        the undisturbed wilderness of Myzan and its neighboring countries. They stalk the skies high
                        above in search of food: birds, rodents, and various untamed beasts including bears. Though very
                        uncommon, an Avalerion can be spotted administering aid to a man in need, healing wounds or
                        providing transportation over treacherous terrain. <br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Conflagrationists hold these birds in high esteem. Known as the
                        Norgalad in the elvish tongue, fervent worshipers of the Great Phoenix, Algaruin, believe that
                        the Avalerion are the godï¿½s personal servants sent down from the Heavens to preserve the skies
                        for the great coming of their mighty idol. The appearance of an Avalerion is a sign of good
                        fortune such as a good harvest or the birth of a healthy child. If one is seen agitated, its
                        wings spread and tense, and squawking fiercely, then disaster is sure to be near.<br>
                        <br>
                        According to ancient lore, the Avalerion were born of the Angels or one of there firstborn,
                        perhaps the Phoenix itself. The great fowl was entrusted with guarding the heavenly places and
                        the wild lands of the infant Myzor from the darkness of the oblivion so that the Newborns could
                        inhabit the world without fear. It is from this legend that the Conflagrationists derive their
                        doctrine and from which they justify their high regard for the beautiful Avalerion.<br>
