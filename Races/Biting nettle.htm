                            title='Female Picture' align=left>The Biting Nettle is a smallish plant that has a short
                        stalk with soft green leaves that are covered with silky hairs. They bear flowers and the base
                        of the plant has yellowish, spreading roots. The stem of the plant has the same silky hairs as
                        the leaves. These hairs are deceptive. Beautiful and silky they may be but they release a toxin
                        when touched that causes great pain and sores.<br></td>

                        herb found in many areas of Myzan. A young Diviner fell in love with a beautiful woman who had
                        many suiters. One of these suiters was a well-known warrior and the diviner feared he would lose
                        his love to him. Hearing that the warrior planned a luncheon in the shady forest with the lady,
                        the diviner decided to create something that would keep the warrior too busy to go. He grabbed a
                        handful of nettle, cast a spell on it and told it to attack the warrior. Unfortunately for him,
                        the nettle wasn`t a very intelligent creature and he had to give it a push to send it on its
                        way. The young diviner fell to the ground from the pain and developed an instant rash all over
                        his body. And the nettle? Once it<br>
                        reached the forest, it went its own way and became a nuisance for everyone.<br></td>
