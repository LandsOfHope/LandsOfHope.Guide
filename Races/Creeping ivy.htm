main stem.  A large, toothed jaw tops the ivy`s body giving it a deadly deadly appearance.<br>
Tiny roots at the base of the plant writhe and wiggle giving this plant its mobility.  <br>
Although the Creeping Ivy only stands a few feet tall, it still can cause havoc where<br>
ever it goes because it never travels alone.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The Creeping Ivy is one of the oddities of Myzan.  Once a hardy plant that many used<br>
to grow upon their houses to help keep them shaded, they now are mobile, carnivorous<br>
plants that roam Myzan looking for food.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>During the Great War many odd beings were created in order to cause major disruptions and the Creeping Ivy was one of them.  The mage who decided on the ivy plant for this figured that this wide spread plant would be perfect.  Found just about every where on Myzan, the ivy was easy to change.  What he didn`t take into account was the great hordes of uncontrollable pests that would ravage both sides of the battle.  Whole armies were scattered when this blood thirsty plant smelled the bloodletting  and swarmed the battleground.  Today the Creeping Ivy has been culled down quite a bit and now can only be found in certain areas of Myzan.  It is still a very dangerous plant and quite often after defeating one, residue such as earrings, hats and skeleton bones from vanquished foes can found within the plant` corpse.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Juratania</td><td bgcolor='#5A8A13'>Forest</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/266.gif'></td><td><b>earring</b><br>Spawn Chance: Guaranteed</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/267.gif'></td><td><b>earring</b><br>Spawn Chance: 10%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Axeman</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Battler</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Forager</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Rampager</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
