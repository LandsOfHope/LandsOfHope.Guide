The fur called wool covers their bodies and has a greasy feel which gives the sheep a small waterproof layer.  The wool is thick and tangled looking. It can be various colors but is often white, brown, or grey.  <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Among the most dimwitted animals in the world, sheep often get lost in their own territory.  In fact so many have become lost that a new breed of wild sheep has developed.  Oddly a strong wind or a long nap will often confuse a sheep.  Although they are not counted among the intelligent, Sheep can be a challenging opponent when provoked.  The male sheep, called a ram, grows large horns that are extremely strong.  Females do not grow horns but have other weapons in their arsenal.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Legend has it that sheep are the godsï¿½ answer to the cold.  Wool is an incredible insulator against the elements.  Many believe that the gods once went for a walk through the world together.  They traveled through many lands and many different climates just for enjoyment.  Soon they traveled to the coldest points on the planet.  It was so cold that even the gods themselves were chilled.  They decided that if man wanted to live there they should have protection from the elements.  The god of mining told of a metal that could be created but that would be very complicated.  The goddess of weather suggested changing the climate but was turned down because it would change the entire planet.  Finally the god of animals suggested making an animal that could give them a source of clothing that could be rain snow and cold resistant.  They all agreed with this idea and the sheep was created.  As a final touch they taught man how to use the wool to make clothing.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Knotwood Valley</td><td bgcolor='#5A8A13'>Forest</td><td bgcolor='#407528'>Tall Grass</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Animal</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Mounting Effects</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/s/186.png'></td><td><b>Sheep: Speed I</b><br>Rider Level: 1<br>Mount Level: 1</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>SPEED</b> 36</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/s/186.png'></td><td><b>Sheep: Speed II</b><br>Rider Level: 100<br>Mount Level: 100</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>SPEED</b> 170</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/s/186.png'></td><td><b>Sheep: Speed III</b><br>Rider Level: 250<br>Mount Level: 250</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>SPEED</b> 270</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img srchttps://res.landsofhope.com/game/e/s/186.png'></td><td><b>Sheep: Speed IV</b><br>Rider Level: 1000<br>Mount Level: 1000</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>SPEED</b> 470</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
