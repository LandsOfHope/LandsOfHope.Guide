They have a long sticky tongue they use to catch insects with. The frog will propel itself with its strong hind legs and have the ability to jump over twenty times its body length. The front legs are very short and the hind legs are almost twice the length of its body and have webbed feet which make it a very strong swimmer. Frogs come in many different colors and sizes. Male frogs are very vocal creatures and the "singing" they do is really a teritorial warning to other males.<br>
<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Frogs are amphibians that inhabit the swamps and fens of Sandydale. Frogs are a cold-blooded species and have a very unique life cycle. Hatched from eggs, the young, called tadpoles, at first glance look like fish.  Soon they develop four legs, the tail disappears and the young frog becomes a land animal.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Frogs have always been a part of Myzan.  Some areas are well known for dining on fried frog legs while others have taboos against eating frogs. It is even said that there is an odd religion that worships the frog and believes that a frog is the reincarnation of an obscure god. No matter what, the frog is one of the most interesting creatures<br>
