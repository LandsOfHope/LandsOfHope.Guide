Its "tongue" can extend out from its jaws several feet. It is sticky and is often used to hold some form of bait for its prey. They have been observed to eat anything in Juratania, including expedition members. While its assumed they have some way to reproduce, no expedition member has been brave enough to check for differences between genders.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Mantraps are a curious species of plant found only in the lands known as Juratania. They seem to be related to munchers and others of the like, but have evolved a much higher intelligence and ability to adapt. When the Eversight expedition first encountered them, they saw it luring a triceratops into its mouth using other vegetation as bait on its tongue. A few days later, the Eversight expedition had lost some members when it was discovered that the mantraps were using pieces of equipment and such they had found to bait themselves for far more intelligent and greedy prey. Since then, every new expedition member has it repeated to them before they reach the main encampment; "Leave the loot, keep your life."<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Mantraps were an unknown species of plant until the Eversight expedition discovered them in Juratania. Woode scholars at the university believe them to be a relative of the creeper and muncher species that was cut off from the rest at least a million years before. The intelligence and cunning these plants show was surpriseing to even them.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>WATER SURVIVAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Juratania</td><td bgcolor='#5A8A13'>Forest</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/5096.gif'></td><td><b>mantrap vine</b><br>Spawn Chance: 14%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Unknown</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
