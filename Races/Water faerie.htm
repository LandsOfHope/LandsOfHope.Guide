                        is often difficult to spot a water faerie; they don�t readily appear to have a physical form as
                        they drift and swim about the waves and currents, but rather look as though they are the water,
                        flowing downstream in fluid grace. They reside in and among the water itself, wherever it may
                        be. When a water faerie does emerge from the water, it takes the form of small pixie-like
                        creature with smooth, azure skin, webbed hands and feet, and fin-like extensions on their arms
                        and legs. They always appear as though they are clothed in robes of mystical waters unknown to
                        land dwellers.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Water faeries are believed to be the guardians of the great Water
                        Elemental. They live within and diligently serve the waters of Myzan, protecting its sources and
                        overlooking the many streams and rivers that transport the Element throughout the world. They
                        are as subtle as a babbling creek and are as mighty as the vast ocean�s waves. Usually unnoticed
                        by land dwellers, it is the charge of the water faeries to make sure that there is pure water
                        available for all.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Like many other mana-rich races, the history of the water faeries is
                        long and largely unknown by men. In fact, it has only been just recently that these faeries have
                        been recognized by the citizens of Myzan. Water faeries have been very content to live their
                        lives away from men and even elves, serving the Elementals as they were charged many, many years
                        ago by the Angels themselves. But now that Myzan has fallen into perpetual war and unrest, the
                        life-giving properties of water are all the more important for the peoples of Myzan. Therefore,
                        water faeries have become more visible as they strive to bring some measure of relief to Myzan�s
                        suffering.<br></td>
