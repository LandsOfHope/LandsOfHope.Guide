                        A Hrrtani is a small humanoid being. With a tiny rodent like face and a sleek furry upright body
                        the Hrrtani makes a strangely attractive creature. Very quick and agile, the Hrrtani has the
                        ability to see far into the distance and has developed excellent hearing making it a good
                        hunter.<br></td>

                        certain areas of Myzan almost seem to be nothing but holes in the ground as the Hrrtani tend to
                        live very close to one another.<br></td>

                        have been a few that were brave enough to leave home and serve Myzan. One of the most famous was
                        a youngling by the name of Trkkysta who was a scout for the exiles. His abilities saved the
                        lives of his band many a time during his time with the troop. For years the Hrrtani have been
                        known as a prankster race. Stealthy and sly, they have a well developed sense of humor and love
                        to play jokes upon those who wander near their homes.<br></td>
