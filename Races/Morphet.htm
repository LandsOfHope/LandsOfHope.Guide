Their wings are functional, allowing them flight. In their natural form, morphets are colorfully distinct between the genders. When hiding, they can perfectly mimic whatever they wish to hide as with very few telltale signs. <br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Morphets are a shy, cautious race. Their true form is that of a small winged dragon like creature. They are highly intelligent, but most are skittish. Their evolution on Myzan has allowed them to gain the abilities to mimic not only the form, but also many other traits and aspects of other creatures to better hide and protect it. Never assume something is what you think, it could just be a morphet hiding.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>The history of the morphet species is still a bit of a mystery. They have only recently (about three hundred years ago) became common knowledge. Before that time they were virtually unknown due to their racial abilities of mimicry.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Barren Downs</td><td bgcolor='#1DEF05'>Grass</td><td bgcolor='#4288F0'>River</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Coldbreeze</td><td bgcolor='#348749'>Heath</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Seven Sisters</td><td bgcolor='#1DEF05'>Grass</td><td bgcolor='#ABD896'>Plains</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Animal</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Woundtender</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
