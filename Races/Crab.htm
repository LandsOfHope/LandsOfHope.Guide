They bear a flat armored shell which protects their abdomens from predators.  A crab is a nervous creature that will run for its hole when danger approaches but will defend itself when cornered.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Crabs live near the waters of Myzan and can be seen scuttling aroung the shores and river banks digging holes to hide in.  Generally a weak beast, the crab can still cause pain and damage from using its massive front claws.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Crabs have been considered a delicacy near sea towns and at one time were almost hunted out of existance.  It was only when corpses found on beaches lay there rotting and stenching that it was understood that crabs played an important part of keeping Myzan clean.  Still considered a great source of food, the crab is also protected as a scavenger and it is slowly rebuilding as a species.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>POISON MAGIC</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/395.gif'></td><td><b>flesh</b><br>Spawn Chance: 15%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Creature</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
