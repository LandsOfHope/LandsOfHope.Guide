                            title='Female Picture' align=left>Nightstalkers are surprisingly fair creatures. They are
                        often human in appearance, though pale skinned and possibly a little sunken in the face. They
                        get their general good looks from their true forms as vampires, which are very fair, even
                        beautiful, to look upon. They too have elongated and sharpened fangs like their brethren, as
                        well as razor-sharp clawed fingertips. These features, unlike those of the vampire, can not be
                        masked from prey, for nightstalkers lack the psychic abilities of vampires.<br>

                        A newly turned or turning nightstalker may appear as a tattered, mangled, and decomposing corpse
                        � the results of the vicious attack that caused the curse.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>At night, Myzan is often a peaceful land of forests, fields, and
                        mountain ranges. But there are wonderers that journey at night, seeking the unsuspecting and the
                        helpless. These Nightstalkers are dreaded by travelers forced to spend their night away from the
                        protection of a village or town inn. Nightstalkers are a race of lesser vampires, the product of
                        an incomplete or failed transformation from living to vampire. The bite of a nightstalker
                        carries the same curse as that of their higher brethren; therefore, any unfortunate victim of a
                        nightstalker attack is subject to possibly becoming a nightstalker himself, or even a
                        vampire.<br></td>

                        Vampires don�t even recall the first of their lesser kin; indeed, many vampires look down on
                        nightstalkers, claiming them not to be of full vampiric blood, giving halflings more respect.
                        However, no vampire can deny that the nightstalkers are vital to the continued survival of the
                        Undead. A person bitten by a nightstalker is turned into a necryte soon after death if the curse
                        was passed on. This stage of living decay is a springboard for further evolution; many go on to
                        become nightstalkers, others become vampires, and still others become more abominable creatures.
                        Also, because of the nightstalkers� inherent urge to roam the night for blood, the Reaper horde
                        has long employed them as scouts and watchmen.<br></td>
