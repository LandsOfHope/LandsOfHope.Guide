                        jut out of their bottom jaw causing an extreme overbite. This overbite gives the orcs an
                        unintelligent leering grin. Though their speech is often a broken and primitive form of the
                        common tongue, their eyes belie an unlikely intelligence.<br></td>

                        often possess those things also. The lowest ranks are often filled by the thieves, magic users,
                        farmers and the like. These are known as "Uhga" within the clans and, while despised, they are
                        tolerated because they are necessary.<br>

                        weak bodies. An ancient text reveals the existence of a cult of a cruel god that feeds of
                        self-hate. It is said that the worship of this god changed a large group of his followers. As
                        they sank deeper and deeper into this worship their skin began to change into putrid colors,
                        they grew tusks and became increasingly hideous. Though these changes made them outcasts, their
                        bodies became stronger and they developed immunities to some of the diseases that killed many
                        humans. Although they loved their new changes, they became social outcasts from civilized
                        cities. Humans began to hunt this cult until a wise king saw that the orcs were beginning to
                        become stronger than Myzanï¿½s armies could handle. The constant battle turned this race into
                        strict warriors. Although tension still exists between the people, the bridges of peace are
                        beginning to be built.<br></td>
