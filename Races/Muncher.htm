                        small delicate flowers that cover the fields of Myzan. They have a large flower head that is
                        split in the middle and harbors large rows of teeth. A long spindly stem supports the massive
                        head and carries the leaves that are used as hands. Munchers have the ability to uproot
                        themselves and move but are quite slow.<br></td>

                        claim this honor alone. They brought many plants to life but the first was the muncher. A large
                        problem arose when the Munchers began multiplying rapidly. Common food sources began to
                        disappear and the munchers were desolating the ground around them. Many forests died as a
                        result. So in response the druids magically modified the plants to be carnivores. They figured
                        that this would help control the animal population as well as the plants. They did not count on
                        the munchers gaining a taste for wood. Therefore they began to destroy large numbers of the
                        plants and carefully controlling their breeding.<br></td>
