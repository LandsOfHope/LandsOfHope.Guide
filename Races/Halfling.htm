Halflings are often �round� and jolly.  They have very tough feet which allow them to walk bare foot often though, many wear shoes or boots especially in colder climates.  A Halfling�s skin can be any color that a human�s can and their hair is often brown, although some rare Halflings have had blonde or red hair.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Happy and fun loving, Halflings bring a beautiful light to Myzan.  Their joy and simple peace give them a charm that even the most evil Reaper can�t resist.  This is why they attack Halflings so often.  Halflings have a very mischievous spirit and often find themselves in strange situations.  They are also very stealthy and can steal from your pocket while looking you in the eyes.  These �gifts� make them excellent rogues.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Halflings as a race have been around about as long as most of the other major races.  These small beings have a unique history in the annals of time.  Long ago the Halflings were united into one large tribe.  They were very happy with the way things were and their settlement grew and grew.  Eventually, the Halflings grew to hate the large settlement.  Many thought it was much too crowded, others thought it was too noisy, some thought it was too busy and a few thought that the settlement was just too smelly.<br>
<br>
The Halflings that thought the settlement was too large scattered into small bands and set up settlements in secluded places.  Those who wanted peace and quiet settled near the rivers.  They found that the rhythmic noises comforted them and they were the first and only Halflings to build boats.  Those who wanted a slow relaxed life decided to become farmers and support the other settlements, so these Halflings never settled together.  The Halflings that thought the settlement too smelly scattered whimsically across the lands of Myzan looking for fields of flowers and peaceful forests to settle in.  Sadly, most of these Halflings didn�t survive their exploration as they neglected common sense and went into dangerous lands without weapons or food.<br>
