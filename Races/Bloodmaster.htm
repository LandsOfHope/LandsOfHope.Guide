                            align=left>Bloodmasters are vampires, and as such, they are the most fair of the fairest
                        night walkers. They are often chosen or descendent from the high-class society of Vampire Lords.
                        Because of this, and in respect to their lofty position, Counts and Countesses dress in fine
                        apparel and keep themselves impeccably groomed and pampered. Among humans, a Bloodmaster can
                        easily blend in with the most regal of aristocrats while still being able to shed all propriety
                        to mix with the basest of commoners.<br></td>

                        The Bloodmaster is the strongest vampire of the clan, superior in mental and physical strength
                        as well as in speed and proficiency, both in battle and on the hunt. He or she is the pride of
                        the clan, a mentor to the faithful, and a foil for the overly ambitious. Within the Reaper
                        horde, Bloodmasters hold the highest ranks along with the more intelligent and devious of the
                        undead races.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>It seems Bloodmasters have been leading the Reaper faction for
                        longer than originally believed. Some now concede that the first Necromancers were inspired to
                        experiment with various life magics by vampires. Because vampires are, to an extent, perfect
                        necrytes, the Necromancers of old based their earliest spells on the vampiric curse. From these
                        early spells came the first tomes and scripts of necromancy.<br>
                        <br>
                        The goal of the vampires at the time was to artificially create other undead creatures to do
                        their bidding. The Bloodmasters of the time were trying to amass an army to combat the growing
                        number of paladins and hunters threatening to wage war on the vampire race. After many years of
                        war with the feral creatures of the woodlands, the vampire nation was recovering much slower
                        than expected. With the Necromancers experimenting ambitiously with reversing sickness and
                        death, Bloodmasters were hoping that some of those experiments would go horribly wrong. And
                        indeed, many did just that.<br>
                        <br>
                        Few of those scheming Bloodmasters are in power now, overthrown by a new breed of worthy
                        vampires and a host of other Undead races. However, the goal � the army � was thoroughly
                        achieved. Now the Reaper horde seeks to make its claim to the land of Myzan. At the helm of the
                        Reaper forces, there are Bloodmasters.<br>
