                        Gyrians are much the same size as humans but their bones are quite fragile and not as dense as
                        the humans which enables them to take flight and sustain it. They have wings that span up to six
                        feet from tip to tip and are covered with beautiful feathers and soft down. Rather than hair on
                        their heads, they have long feathery plumes.<br>
