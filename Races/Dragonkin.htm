                        wings on their back. Clan members are very muscular and agile. Their skin is often shades of red
                        but can also be any other color. Color is often an indicator of their lineage and some colors
                        refuse to breed with others. <br></td>

                        It takes two years for a Dragon Kin to hatch from an egg. The eggs themselves are very large and
                        when the Kin hatch they are nearly fully grown. Clan members all participate in the raising and
                        teaching of the Kin. Kin take the mantle of full Clansmen after 10 years of education. At this
                        time they have chosen and began mastery of one of the many Clan professions.<br>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Many ancient traditions claim that the old dragons were able to
                        magically change form. These intelligent and capable dragons would often take the form of
                        humans. Some would even fall in love with them resulting in a crossbred offspring. This is the
                        beginning of the Dragon Clan. Of ten the friends and family of the crossbred child would
                        excommunicate the mother and child from civilization. Mother and child would search for the
                        dragon father and the dragons would gather their offspring into colonies. These colonies were
                        where the dragons would teach the Dragon Clan many things. Today the old knowledge of the wyrms
                        lives and thrives even when the old dragons are long gone.<br></td>
