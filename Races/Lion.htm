The males often weigh over 400 pounds and may stretch more than ten feet long from head to tail. Usually a deep golden color with a wild russet mane, the male lion is often thought of as a noble creature.  The females are a little smaller but are the epitome of grace in the wild. The lion`s roar can be heard for miles striking fear into all who hear it.<br>
<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>Lions are massive animals that live on the wild plains  of Myzan.  They are very social animals that live in a pride comprised of the lionesses, several dominate lions and all their offspring. Besides caring for the young cubs, the females of the pride are also the hunters. The males fight for the right to produce the next generation of<br>
cubs but the females are the ones who insure that the pride survives.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Lions used to live closer to the southern desert but were once hunted almost to extinction by the Sithanu tribes that roam the sands. It is believed that a male Sithanu can not become an adult until he makes his own necklace of lion`s teeth woven onto twists of lion mane. Only by moving onto the grassy plains were the lions able to once <br>
again become the noble rulers of the wild.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Loot Drops</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/395.gif'></td><td><b>flesh</b><br>Spawn Chance: 15%</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/rgf.gif'></td><td><b>Ring</b><br>Spawn Chance: 30%</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td><img src='https://res.landsofhope.com/game/i/bds.gif'></td><td><b>rotting arm</b><br>Spawn Chance: 2%</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Animal</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Clawstriker</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Creature</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Forager</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
