                            title='Female Picture' align=left>In these dark times, it best not to try and discern the
                        difference between a Grim Reaper and the smaller, more aggressive, Bloody Reaper. Such wasted
                        time in battle will surely mean certain death as both reapers look very similar and will not
                        hesitate to strike down any foe before them. Few engage a Grim Reaper in a fight and live to
                        tell the tale, fewer still have survived an encounter with a Bloody Reaper.<br>
                        <br>
                        Those who have lived through such a fight caution against a fight with these demons robed in
                        hooded cloaks as dark as a starless night. They say that the red glow that pours from their eyes
                        is enough to cool the blood of any fierce warrior. Its jaws chatter wildly in delight of its
                        vile amusement � namely, death. And its weapon of choice � a long, blood-stained sickle � is
                        often described as nigh unbeatable, indeed, unnatural. <br>

                        the legion of Bloody Reapers. More aggressive and vengeful than the Grim variety, Bloody Reapers
                        stalk the earth in search of souls to devour. They are motivated by no cause other than
                        bloodshed. Most priests and exorcists agree that Bloody Reapers were once upholders of justice
                        in the same vain as the greater Grim Reaper; however, these demons have developed a mad hunger
                        for the violence they regularly brought to those who were most deserving of it. It is now a
                        desire, a lust, so strong that they now exist solely for devastation.<br></td>

                    <td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Undoubtedly the pride of the First Horde, the legion of Bloody
                        Reapers has spread terror and havoc throughout Myzan since the first Followers turned on the
                        Light for Darkness. After the defeat of the original Horde, the legion seemed to disappear. Many
                        had thought that the reapers had returned to the depths of the Underworld from whence it was
                        believed they came. In truth, they were waiting for the new breed of Undead to awaken from their
                        graves.<br>
                        <br>
                        Now there is talk of the return of the Red Death, advance units of the Horde bent on death and
                        disruption, named and modeled after the Bloody Reapers of the First. As the Reapers become more
                        organized as a faction, it is believed that the Red Death units will become more of a threat, no
                        longer attacking randomly causing panic, but striking in definite, purposed patterns in order
                        instill fear while serving a true strategic purpose for the Horde proper. It is unknown whether
                        or not the Bloody Reaper legion will be apart of this movement, but the armies of Myzan will
                        prepare for them just the same.<br>
