                            align=left>Rough, green hued skin covers a very muscular humanoid body. Orcs have tusks that
                        jut out of their bottom jaw causing an extreme overbite. This overbite gives the orcs an
                        unintelligent leering grin. Orc warriors often wear the toughest armor they can find or
                        scavenge. Though their speech is often a broken and primitive form of the common tongue, their
                        eyes belie an unlikely intelligence. <br></td>

                        These descriptions are the often correct stereotypes of a very complex culture. Their history is
                        deep and long. Clan social structure is often misunderstood by other races. Many find it
                        difficult to believe that honor is very important to an orc.<br>

                        The most respected and feared among the orc clans, orc warriors are held in high esteem. There
                        are few old orc warriors as they are known to throw themselves into battle without a second
                        thought. They will attack without warning anything that is not an orc (and some who are). The
                        warrior code of an orc is the most important law that they live by. Honor among the warrior
                        class dictates that one warrior will not �steal a kill� (attack an enemy that is already
                        engaged). These codes are what orc clans live and die by.<br>

                        weak bodies. An ancient text reveals the existence of a cult of a cruel god that feeds of
                        self-hate. It is said that the worship of this god changed a large group of his followers. As
                        they sank deeper and deeper into this worship their skin began to change into putrid colors,
                        they grew tusks and became increasingly hideous. Though these changes made them outcasts, their
                        bodies became stronger and they developed immunities to some of the diseases that killed many
                        humans. Although they loved their new changes, they became social outcasts from civilized
                        cities. Humans began to hunt this cult until a wise king saw that the orcs were beginning to
                        become stronger than Myzan�s armies could handle. The constant battle turned this race into
                        strict warriors. Although tension still exists between the people, the bridges of peace are
                        beginning to be built.<br></td>
