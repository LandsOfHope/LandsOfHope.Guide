Their long, slender bodies can reach lengths of up to three meters from nose to tail end.  Their diamond shaped heads are flanked on each side by small, beady eyes that are covered by a thin membrane to protect them from the water and its containments.  The head is tipped by pitted nostrils, and inside the mouth are the snake�s forked tongue and folded fangs.  Each fang houses a tube that runs through the enlarged tooth to a gland just above the roof of the mouth; where up to a teaspoon of venom is produced and stored at a time.<br>
<br>
Known to occasionally venture into shallow waters or even on land in search of food, a sea snake can be identified by its diamond patterned scales and webbed fin extensions on its tail and sides.<br>
<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The open seas of Myzan are home to many aquatic creatures.  Towards the top of the marine food chain is the sea snake.  A solitary brother of the traditional land-bound snake, the sea snake is a sensational swimmer and an exceptional hunter.  Though normally a docile creature, one that would rather flee from danger than confront it, and one that prefers to spend most of its time alone traversing the open ocean in search of food and shelter, the sea snake can be very dangerous when aggravated; its potent venom can kill within minutes once it has entered the body.  Its strike is quick and shocking, and only a small amount of poison is released � yet only a small amount is ever necessary.  They usually feed on small or medium sized fish, small crustaceans, and on some occasions, sharklings.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>It is believed that sea snakes are the pre-evolved ancestors of the land snake.  Able to live in both water and on land with considerable ease and finesse, the sea snake appears to be the evolutionary reason that most all snakes are great swimmers and quick as lightning on land.  However, these aquatic reptiles prefer to keep their time on land to a minimum.  They can spend days at a time out at sea and hours under the waves. <br>
<br>
Sailors have come to fear sea snakes because of their adeptness in the water and their resemblance to the more dangerous sea serpent or dragon.  Sea snakes have become a large part of the mariners� lore, up among the likes of the sea serpent and mermaid.   Not only looked upon as a legitimate threat if crossed the wrong way, sailors have also found that sea snakes can be a fine delicacy when away from port. <br>
