Its plumage is a rather drab, olive green broken here and there by darker bands of green. The only break in coloration is the brightly pigmented skin of its head and the white ruff of feathers that encircles the base of the neck.<br>
<br>
Unlike most birds which have feathers from head to tail, the scavenger sports a completely bald head and neck, the skin there ranging in color from a light to darker blue. This keeps the scavenger clean, for it can eat its fill without blood and gore becoming clumped in feathers around its head. It also has a heavy, curved beak that is made for tearing flesh.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>When death hangs in the air, scavengers appear, wheeling overhead on great, greenish wings. Slowly, they circle above, letting the gentle air currents carry them down�down�until they drop beside the corpse of an unfortunate animal or traveler. They quickly set to eating the repugnant flesh, tearing strips of muscle and sinew from bone and gulping it down their long, naked necks. Dark, beady eyes warily watch any who approach, ready to defend their meal from any who would encroach upon their territory.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>High in the mountains lays a small village known as Granvale. Unlike most people who view scavengers as unclean animals to be shunned, the Granvalians revere them. They are considered to be messengers of the gods who carry away the spirits of the dead to the realm beyond.<br>
<br>
On the third day after a Granvalian dies, the family gathers on a hilltop and says prayers over the shrouded corpse of their beloved relative, kneeling peacefully under the sky as they chant and sing. They then gently remove the shroud, leaving the corpse naked and vulnerable to the elements. Backing away, they leave a large circle around the corpse and wait. It doesn�t take long for the scavengers to come, for they have been part of this ritual for centuries.<br>
<br>
The Granvalians watch as the great birds descend upon the corpse and consume it. To many, this would seem a disgraceful way to treat the honored dead. However, for the Granvalians, it is only natural that it be the Spirit Messengers of the Gods who would take the soul of the departed to the heavens. The consumption of the flesh is only a physical representation of the transformation from mortal to spirit, of the changing of energy from material to light.<br>
<br>
Once the flesh is stripped from bones and the scavengers have carried away their beloved�s spirit, the Granvalians gather the bones and crush them into a powder, leaving no trace of the physical self on this world. In this way, the dead�s journey to the realm beyond is complete.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Event Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Event Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Challenge Realm</td><td bgcolor='#36853A'>Woodlands</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Unknown</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
