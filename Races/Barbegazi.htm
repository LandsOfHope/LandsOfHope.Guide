Barbegazi as a culture has never needed to distinguish as much as other races. It comes through in the clothing choices mostly. They are roughly half the size of gnomes. Fair skin, and white hair, that they wear animal skin caps to protect from the frozen lands.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>General</b><br>The Barbegazi are a cousin of the gnomish race. Preferring to stay out of sight in the colder climates. They, as a society, are skilled at both healing magic and those of the illusionary arts. Their nature as observers and staying out of the way have given them an almost second sight when looking for those people, creatures and things that are hidden. They can be friendly if approached right. They live and roam the snow planes of Frostvale.<br></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><b>History</b><br>Little was known about them until a university expedition ran into trouble crossing the ice and snow planes of Frostvale. All hope was lost until a clan of Barbegazi took in the party. Much of what is known about them comes from this encounter. They have a rich clan tradition like gnomes, but tend to leave the mechanical world alone unlike their cousins. They take more joy in just spending days in the snow playing or hunting. Some even make use of their natural talent in creating convincing illusions to become performers.<br></td></tr><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Skills</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>COLD RESISTANCE</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #ff6666'>DETECT HIDDEN</td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td style='color: #66ff66'>FISTS</td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=10 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Habitat</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td colspan=12><b>Realms</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td>Frostvale</td><td bgcolor='#FFFFFF'>Snow</td><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table><br><table style='width: 415' border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td height=22 align=center class='navmenu' colspan=2 style='height: 15'><center><b>Known Professions</b></center></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Conjurer</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Creature</b></td></tr><tr class='weakcell'><td></td><td><b>Woundtender</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan='2'></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
