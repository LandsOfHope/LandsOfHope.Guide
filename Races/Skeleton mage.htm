                        that: skeletons. There is a key difference, however. They frequently seem to have glowing balls
                        of flame surrounding the bones of their fists. These are pure, raw magical power, used to
                        control other skeletons, or cast whatever spell they need to. Occasionally, they are seen
                        wearing scraps of clothing, as heavier, metal armor would restrict their movement, thus
                        restricting their ability to cast spells. <br></td>

                        previous lifetime, but they are also those that were imbued with that ability after they were
                        reanimated. Some necromancers summon the creatures to do their bidding when the simple grunts
                        that are skeleton warriors simply won�t do the job. Some of the skeleton magi can even summon up
                        more skeletons to do their bidding, and, therefore, their master�s bidding as well. <br>
                        Skeleton Magi can cast a variety of spells, mainly from whatever spell school their master
                        wills. The skeleton magi are dangerous, yet can be overcome. Only skilled adventurers, however,
                        should try to combat these creatures.<br>

                        Skeleton Magi are the lesser of the spell casting undead. They have served as the front line
                        magic users in large scale battles, or have been behind scenes commanders in smaller skirmishes.
                        They have frequently been the reason the Reapers have won battles. While they distracted the
                        enemy, the more powerful spell casters would prepare the immensely powerful spells that would,
                        in the end, finish their opponents. <br></td>
