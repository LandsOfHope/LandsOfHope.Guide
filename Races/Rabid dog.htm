                            title='Female Picture' align=left>Rabid dogs appear much the same as common dogs with small
                        differences. They have a body with four legs and a bushy tail that is covered with thick,
                        protective fur that usually comes in various shades of browns. The main differences are on the
                        head area. Instead of the brownish eyes of the <br>
                        common dog, the eyes of the rabid dog are a pure red which seems to glow in the dark. It also
                        has massive fangs that have poison ducts much like snake fangs. Once a rabid dog bites down, it
                        is almost impossible to break the jaws loose since they lock into place.<br>

                        strange diseases ran rampant through the world. It is believed that a dog was bitten by a snake
                        during a fight and wild magic changed the genetics of the dog. From that day<br>
                        forward the rabid dog was no longer an ill animal but a true breed with the poisonous ability
