                        prey. Graceful and extremely beautiful in appearance, it is hard to believe that creatures so
                        wonderful looking can have hearts of stone so dedicated to death. The males of the species are
                        very dexterous and strong which combined with their deep hatred make them the perfect warriors.
                        The females have the same innate beliefs of superiority and fight along side the males. There is
                        no sight as horrible as the gleam of glee in a female`s beautiful eyes as she strikes a killing
                        blow.<br></td>

                        land deep within caves and caverns. Known to be a vicious, spell-casting race. they embrace the
                        dark side and despise all races that believe in "Good". Humans who attempt to<br>
                        settle near mountain ranges have learned to their dismay that the drow come up to the surface
                        during the night and attack anyone they can find just for the fun of killing. The drow`s deepest
                        passion lies in believing that all other races are inferior and there for the sport of hunting
                        and slaying.<br>
                        <br>
                        The drow society is ruled by the female line. Even the greatest male sorceror or warrior is far
                        below the least of the females. The drows are vicious within their own society and one is raised
                        in class usually by murdering those above them. The children are raised to believe that
                        treachery and deception are the only way to live and that love and compassion are weaknesses one
                        should avoid.<br>

                        the elvish race. According to legends, the drow were once part of the elven nation but
                        differences of opinion in how to conduct war and the rules and standards caused the drow to cut
                        all ties with their kin and move far away. No one knows why the drow settled into the<br>
                        underground world. Rumor has it that many of the spell casters began to experiment with
                        necromacy and that spells gone awry changed the drow in such ways that the sun caused them pain
                        and death so they fled underground in order to survive.<br>
                        <br>
                        It is said that long ago a drow shunned the underground world and turned to the good <br>
                        side. His name was struck from the drow history. Although books have been written about him in
                        the human world, all drows deny that he ever existed and that he was a farce created by the
                        humans to weaken the drow structure.<br>
                        <br>
                        Drows have been known to ally with other evil races but no one can trust those alliances because
                        the drow will turn on an ally in a heartbeat once they no longer have a use for them.<br>
