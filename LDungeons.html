The Legend Dungeons are infact tombs and former homes of the Legends of Myzan, there are many Legends in Myzan. The Legend of Five or the Trials of the Ten as it is sometimes known is perhaps the most well known legend, you can read more on this particular legend <a href='Legends.html'>here</a>.<br><br>
There are 10 known Legend Dungeons, the Historian Elwick who resides at the Citdael in the Royal Hollow has been conducting research on them for many years.<br><br>
Each of the Tombs is magically protected and was thought well sealed from outside forces, Elwick has been lucky enough to discover the Key of the Tenth and now seeks an able bodied Myzan to enter the Tomb of the Tenth and seek out some answers.

<br><br>
The Dungeons are very large ranging from 180 to 257 rooms, they span up to four floors and were designed originally as elaborate tombs to honor Heros of Myzan. As such the Tombs are full of treasures and relics and over time this has attracted Looters and Bandits who have found ways to enter the tombs, one can only assume via tunneling or perhaps large Sandworms imported from the desert.<br><br>
The Looters are not all you will find inside, for it also seems that the old dry passages have been taken over by many different nasty creatures or perhaps these creatures were placed here to guard the treasures from grave robbers!
<br><br>
While building the dungeons the ancient people of Myzan constructed rest chambers at evenly spaced intervals, this allowed them to take breaks when needed and to get nourishment and water without having to return to the surface, you will find these rest rooms are still well equipped with the essentials.
<br><br>
Due to the dangers such as tunnel collapse and the chance there is a foe around every corner, you have to fight through the dungeon a room at a time clearing the room of whatever dangers lurk there before being able to move into the next room.
<br><br>
<b>Spoiler</b><br>
At the very end of the dungeon is a crypt that is said to contain the very bones of one of the Legends, it is well guarded and will not give up its secrets lightly !<br><br>
If you succeed in killing the guardian you will gain a second key which unlocks a chest in the final room, when opening the chest you will lose the key but will be rewarded with a Legend Token (to prove to Elwick you truly reached the end of the dungeon) and also a key to the next Dungeon.
<br><br>
The first nine dungeons offer the key to the next dungeon as a reward from the chest, and then you can go complete the next dungeon.<br><br>
You can complete each dungeon multiple times, and the Legend Tokens you gain can be redeemed with Historian Elwick for Armor and Trinkets or with Legendary Weapon Sellers in the <a href='Battlefield.html'>Battlefield</a> for Legendary Weapons.<br><Br>
You do not need to go back to Historian Elwick after doing each dungeon, it is only necessary to do so if you wish to exchange some of your tokens for a reward.
