                Lands of Hope is a browser based game set in a custom fantasy setting, in a land known as Myzan.
                <br><Br>
                <a href='http://www.landsofhope.com/'>http://www.landsofhope.com/</a>
                <br><Br>
                You can choose to play LoH as one of 4 Allegiances (Neutral, Exile, Society and Reaper), the story is
                still in its infancy but revolves around the age old rivalry between the Exiles and Society and the
                growing power of the Undead Allegiance known as the Reapers.
                <br><Br>
                Lands of Hope features a very comprehensive Interface system that allows you to access game features
                through menus, there are hundreds of menus and over 600 screens that make up the game.
                <br><Br>
                <b>Sound like a Lot ?</b>
                <br><Br>
                <i>Well after coding every single one I can tell you it sure felt like a lot at the time.</i>
                <br><Br>
                The game features an evolution system that means all Players begin as the human race, and then can
                choose to evolve into other races at various level milestones there are over 40 races to evolve into in
                total and they each have unique artwork and will give a onetime bonus to up to three stats (at higher
                level evolutions).
                <br><Br>
                <i>The race choices are different if you join the Reapers</i>
                <br><Br>
                You can choose to start the game as one of 5 different classes ...
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href='/Professions/Archer.htm'>Archer</a></li>
                    <li><a href='/Professions/Caster.htm'>Caster</a></li>

                There are then three distinct evolution lines from each of these five evolutions, offering up over 45
                different playable professions.
                <br><Br>
                Each profession gains an additional skill(s) and gets to keep its previous skills so in that sense you
                can make some pretty wild combinations.
                <br><Br>
                There are over 130 different skills in the game, skills go up through use the more you use a skill the
                higher it goes.
                <br><Br>
                When you evolve any profession skills that you gain from the evolution process will automatically be
                raised to the maximum for your level to ensure that you dont have to play catch up.
                <br><Br>
                There are numerous gathering and crafting skills, and hundreds of recipes for each crafting skill
                allowing someone to spend their time crafting without having to pick up a weapon.
                <br><Br>
                There are plenty of secondary skills like Husbandry, Skinning and Exploration.
                <br><Br>
                There are thousands of Spells and Combat Styles to learn and use, and thousands of Quests to take part
                in.
                <br><Br>
                The game is somewhat different to other browser games in the sense that you need to download all of our
                graphics to your HDD, this is a fairly large file now as there are thousands of images in total the file
                size is up to 12mb.
                <br><Br>
                The benefit of downloading the files is that there is no wait time for images to show up in your browser
                and pages load really quickly because of this.
                <br><Br>
                The game features a tutorial area for new players that you have to start in, there are a number of
                quests and tasks in that new area that if followed ensure you will have a smooth start to the game and
                learn all of the basics.
                <br><Br>
                At Level 5 (which if you do the quests will take no more than 60 minutes to achieve) you can speak to an
                NPC that will let you leave the Tutorial and you will enter the real game.
                <br><Br>
                If you have played other browser based games before, you should totally forget about them when you start
                LoH as it truly is like no other out there it is designed with its players in mind.
                <br><Br>
                The game features hundreds of hours of game play, thousands even .... whats more its idiot creator (yes
                you guessed it thats me) makes changes on a daily basis and adds new features at the request of players.
                <br><Br>
                We have a host of ingame tools for chatting and sending messages to other players, and also ingame
                features for asking for help, submitting help for others to use, FAQs and suggesting Ideas.
                <br><Br>

                Give the game a chance and who knows you might find your Destiny !
