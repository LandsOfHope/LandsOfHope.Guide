**What is powerlevelling?**  
Generally powerlevelling is the term given to someone who levels faster than was intended or simply goes all out to level up and ignores elements of a game that do not provide a means to gain experience.

For many this means things such as Roleplaying are not considered Powerleveller friendly, nor is chatting or helping out others. Although this is not always the case and varies depending on the individuals involved.

**How do I powerlevel?**  
I really tried to stay away from answering this question for a long time because I am not sure I agree with the concept of powerlevelling, I know that many people who powerlevel miss so much of the game because they skip over things that won't help them get experience.

However it seems people are always looking for the quick way to Level or gain Experience so here is the Gamemasters guide to power levelling.

LOOK AWAY NOW UNLESS YOU LIKE POWER ... \*EVIL LAUGH\*

Essential skills:

*   Combat weapon or Magic skills (yes this rules out the Apprentice)
*   Skinning
*   Crafting skill ideally Leatherworking

**General Tips  
**Fine tune your combat skills, get the best armor and weapons you can use ever 5 levels for your first 100 or so levels, after that as long as you update as often as you can you should be fine.

*   Use the Marketeer to find items other players are selling
*   Craft your own weapons and armor.
*   Get new styles/spells as soon as they become available
*   Ride a mount
*   Have a combat pet on hand ideally something setup for melee or magic combat such as a Nobeleman or Flamecaller.

When properly equipped you should aim to one hit kill things most of the time, two or three hit things 100% of the time. After all if a fight takes more than a few rounds its cutting into your power levelling. If you want to level faster fight weaker monsters, this means fight animals ... so many people fight fish its not funny they are readily available and weak enough to die in one hit. They do not drop decent loot but then who cares about loot when you are a mad experience junkie!

After killing a monster, use the Skin Corpse button on the loot screen to skin it, this gets you a resource for crafting and also more free experience.

Buy the Leatherworking skill and at the very least the Prepared Hide plan, then use the Inventory > Tradeskill > Leatherworking screen to turn the hides you gain from skinning into prepared hides, this will not be instant experience but you can queue things up and still fight and gain more hides and experience while it works.

Fully equipped and ready for combat you can kill probably 4 or 5 monsters a minute, combined with experience from skinning and Leatherworking you will be gaining levels very quickly.
