The **Shields** skill is a weapon skill. It is a skill that the following playable classes get:

*   Crusader
*   Grunt
*   Knight
*   Monk
*   Paladin
*   Protector
*   Ranger
*   Salvager
*   Soldier
*   Squire
*   Veteran
*   Warlord
*   Warrior

As with all weapon skills to be able to use weapons that are linked to this skill you must physically know the skill only the classes that get the skill naturally can therefore use shields as you can not train in this skill.

As well as allowing you to equip and use Shield weapons this skill also determines what styles you can learn and therefore use in combat.

This skill is primarily for one handed weapons so with dual wielding class skill you can wield two shields or one shield and another one handed weapon.

As well as dealing damage shields also block physical damage so shield fighting is an excellent way to train.

_For a full list of the styles available for any weapon skill you can use the Library > Styles screen._

_For a full list of the weapons that are tied to a specific skill you can use the Library > Items > Weapons screen._

_To learn new styles visit the appropriate style trainer you can view the locations of style trainers via the Help > Manual > Realm Name guide page._

**Combat Style Use**  
To use a combat style in combat you need three things:

*   Stamina, each style requires a fixed amount of stamina.
*   Skill, each style requires a fixed amount of weapon skill (the same amount that was needed to learn the style from the trainer).
*   Weapon, a style can only be used if the correct type of weapon is equipped.

To attack with a manually chosen combat style click the attack enemy button then choose which style you wish to use.

To attack with a manually chosen ranged combat style click the attack with ranged button then choose which style you wish to use.

You can also ready some styles using the Abilities > Styles screen then use the readied buttons instead of the manual buttons. The game will then pick the best style you have the stats to use that is on your ready list.

As the fight goes on your stamina will go down so the list of available styles will go down.
