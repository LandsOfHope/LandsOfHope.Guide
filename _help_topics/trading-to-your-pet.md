You can trade to pets directly using the standardÂ trade system. This system can be accessed in one of two ways:

*   Mouse over a pet and choose the trade button in the center of the screen.
*   Use Minions > Manage, click on the pet then click Trade

The first page of the trading screen is used to select the things you wish to trade. To select items use click and drag on the left window this may sound like an odd way of doing it but it means you can select a bunch of items quickly without having to take your finger off the mouse button which makes it a pretty quick and intuitive way of doing things.

_You know when an item is selected as its background color will change to indicate that fact._

You can also use the buttons in the middle of the screen to select items in bulk:

*   **Custom**, allows you to enter a word to have all items that contain that word selected.
*   **\***, selects all items that are in a stack on this page of the screen.
*   **(?)**, selects all unidentified items on this page of the screen.
*   **All**, selects all the items on this page of the screen.
*   **None**, deselect all selected items on this page of the screen.
*   **Next**, used to go to the second page of the Trading process.

On the right side of the screen you have a box that allows you to enter an amount of money which will be given along with the items to the person you plan on trading with.

If you wish to trade items from a bag other than the default you can use the bag buttons at the bottom of the screen to switch back and forth between bags.

_You can only trade items from the same page of your inventory in one go so if you plan on trading items across multiple inventory pages you may need to trade several times._

To proceed to the next screen click the Next button in the center column of the screen.

To go back to the previous page to make a change click the **Previous** button at the bottom of the screen otherwise click the **Complete** button to finish this trade and give the items and money to the selected pet.
