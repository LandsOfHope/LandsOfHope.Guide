The **Possession** skill is a class skill that the Invoker and Necromancer classes acquire. It allows you to possess minions. While possessed your minions operate much like a normal character and it allows you to play parts of the game as that possessed minion. This can be fun for roleplaying purposes or simply allow you to do something that your character can not do itself.

_Acquiring items that provide possession skill as a bonus will also work, although you may need several different items to gain the desired effect._

**Skill Use  
**The possession skill can be used via the Minions > Possess screen.

The Possession screen provides a list of all of your pets.

You may only possess one thing at a time, and you can not access the possession screen if you are currently possessing the body of something else.

To possess something, simply click on it and click the possess button. You will then be logged into the minion and have the ability to play it as if you would a character.

_Please note some functions that are available to a player are not available while possessed this is intentional. Also when you possess something your own body will remain visible for 15minutes so if you are on Hellsgate it is wise to not possess something in a public spot or you may find your character has been player killed or stolen from when you return to your body._

To return to your body, click the small picture to the left of the Q symbol, the picture should resemble your characters portrait, click the screenshot above for the exact location.

**Formula  
**Skill Required = (Level \* 5)

_i.e. To possess a level 5 pet you need 25 skill (5 \* 5)._

Possession does not give any experience but it does provide a **guaranteed skill gain**.
