**Casting**  
If you do the Casting quest on the Estate you will gain your first few spells, otherwise you can wait until you leave the estate and purchase them from the magic trainers at 31, 59. This guide will focus on using your spells and not melee/physical attacks.

The spells you can use in combat are determined by how much skill you have in the required magic skill and also how much mana and intelligence you have, therefore it is possible to learn magic spells from a trainer or a Spellbook/scroll that you do not have enough mana or intelligence to actually cast yet, so you do need to pay attention to your mana and intelligence to ensure you have the requirements to cast a spell.

There are generally three types of magic Offensive, Defensive and Buff while each type may have a number of different sub types, these are the three most common types.

*   Offensive, these spells can be cast in combat and directly damage your opponent.
*   Defensive, these spells may either be cast outside of combat to provide some kind of defense or cast inside of combat and usually do not do direct damage.
*   Buff, typically cast outside of combat on either yourself or a friend or minion and provide some form of enhancement to a skill or stat.

As a Healer you should get Improved Health I and Healers Revenge I as well as Healers Aid I from the spell book (at the very least), Improved Health I provides a bonus to your hitpoints it is intended to demonstrate the purpose of Buff type spells. To cast this spell goto Abilities > Spellbook, click on the Spell and then click the relevant button to cast it. This will then give you a 2hour boost to Health.

Also Offensive and Defensive spells can be readied, readying a spell enables you to cast your favourite spells, as your mana goes down through casting the next available readied spell will be used and so on. To ready your spells goto Abilities > Ready Spells, readying a spell is optional you can cast spells without readying them but it requires extra clicks in combat, so most players prefer to ready the spells they wish to use.

Once you initate combat with something, you will find that there are 6 main Healer related combat buttons:

*   Cast offensive spell, press this button to choose what spell to cast from your offensive list of spells.
*   Cast readied offensive spell, press this button to automatically cast a spell from your readied list of offensive spells.
*   Cast defensive spell, press this button to choose what spell to cast from your defensive list of spells.
*   Cast readied defensive spell, press this button to automatically cast a spell from your readied list of defensive spells.
*   Cast healing or cure spell, press this button to choose what spell to cast from your healing spells.
*   Cast readied healing or cure spell, press this button to automatically cast a spell from your readied healing spells.

You can continue to cast spells until the fight is over or you run out of mana, if you run out of mana you may need to switch to using your weapon or drink a mana potion to regain some mana and cast spells again.

Under defensive spells you will be able to cast your Healers Revenge, this is a nice spell as it damages your opponent and also heals you a small amount.

**Future Choices**  
As a Healer at level 50 you can evolve into one of three professions:

1.  Cleric
2.  Friar
3.  Protector

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.
