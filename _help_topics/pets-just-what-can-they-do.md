Pets have a bunch of uses, but predominantly they can be used for the following:

*   Gathering raw resources
*   Crafting items
*   Fighting
*   Minion Husbandry (Milking etc ...)
*   Storage

**Gathering  
**There is a complete guide on how to Gather using Pets in the Help system so it would make more sense to read that page for the workings on how to do it.

Needless to say you can use your pets to gather raw resources once you have trained them in the relevant skill.

**Crafting Items**  
Pets can craft items, to craft with a pet you must visit a crafting skill trainer, click on the trainer then click the Train Pets button at the bottom of the screen. Expand the Following group if it is not expanded, and select the pet you wish to train the skill to.

Next you need to get some plans, visit a plan trainer, use the Train Pets button to select your pet and the plans you wish to have it learnt.

A thing to note before crafting is that the resources you plan on using to craft your items should be in your inventory rather than your pets, this is contrary to how some other screens work but it makes things easier.

Pull up the Info screen for your Pet, and click the Control Tab and then select the crafting skill you wish to use, and it should then show a standard crafting window.

**Fighting**  
Pets can be used in combat, for a pet to fight with you you must have turned on Following and Combat via the Minions > Manage screen, click on the pet then click the appropriate button on the right of the screen. If you plan on fighting with the help of a pet, it is best that you have a pet that is close to your level, or else you will need to fight weaker things to help get it started.

Pets may behave in different ways in combat, it depends on the pets profession you can alter the way the pet works by using the Minions > Manage screen, click on the pet and click the Options button you can then set the script it uses in combat.

Remember that pets will need armor and weapons just like any player, so do not neglect your pets equipment, and if it is a caster make sure to get it new spells as and when you can.

**Husbandry  
**You can care for your pet using the Minion Husbandry skill, the same skill can be used to care for monsters, the purpose is to gather resources from a pet, such as milk from a Cow or a hide etc ... be warned some of the "Caring" processes will destroy your pet. To care for your pet, move the mouse over the pet and click the Care button (first one).

_Caring for your pet is not essential, you do not need to do anything to make it happy or clean up behind it as it doesnt make a mess._

**Storage**  
Some people use their pets as storage, simply trade items to the pet and it can hold on to them for you.
