**Charms and Hexes** is a special class skill it has both crafting and magical uses, this means keeping it raised should be relatively easy as you can gain skill gains from magic casting or from crafting items.

The Enchantress (50) evolution from the Hag class gains this skill.

Plans for this skill can be learnt from the Spotted Pumkin building at 32, 58 in Knotwood Valley.

**Charms and Hexes - Crafting  
**After you have learnt the skill and at least one plan you can access the crafting screen by going to Inventory > Tradeskills > Charms and Hexes.

The crafting screen will list all of the plans you currently have enough skill to use.

_If you learn a plan while you have bonus items to charms and hexes equipped then take the item off and your skill drops below the required skill level for that plan you will not be able to use it until it goes back up to the required skill level._

For more information on the other buttons on the crafting screen please check out the help topic linked below which will explain them in great detail.

To begin constructing a charms and hexes item simply click on the plan on the left of the screen this will cause the bottom of the screen to update and display the ingredient selection box.

The ingredient box as the name suggests lists all of the ingredients that are required to make the item. By default the screen will automatically pick the best ingredients you have for the task at hand but there may be times when you wish to change the ingredients to use a lower level one if you are making items for someone else or to sell, in such cases clicking on the ingredient on the left of the screen will cause the middle of the box to display a list of compatible ingredients you currently have and let you pick one to replace the default it selected.

When you are happy with the list of ingredients you are using simply click the Assemble button on the right side of the screen and the item will be added to your Inventory > Queue screen.

Crafting Charm items gives a **purple skill gain** when using the right level primary ingredient (formula below) and also experience when you finish the item in the queue screen.

If any ingredients on the list show up red it means you are missing those ingredients or you do not have high enough skill to use the ones you have in your inventory.

**Material Formula**  
Material Level = ((Charms and Hexes / 5) + 5)

_i.e. If you have 100 charms and hexes you can work with up to level 25 materials ((100 / 5) + 5)._

This allows you to work around material gaps (times when there is not a material every 5 levels).

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose which spell line you wish to cast spells from. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Cast on me, lets you cast the spell on yourself.
*   Other, lets you choose who to cast the spell on if the spell can be cast on more than just you.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
