At random times during the day an Economy Monster will spawn in KV, the level can be anywhere from 50 to level 1000.

If you kill the monster you get a Job Application, take these Applications to Job Seeker Allowquince inside Coldglen (22, 13) in Knotwood Valley.

For every two Applications you return he will sponsor a Job on the Character > Jobs system (under Browse with a header of Economy Jobs).

These are for raw resources and generally pay pretty well so will help some of your lower level players.
