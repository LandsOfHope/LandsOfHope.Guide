The **Preservation** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the reservation line of magic.

The following playable classes get the reservation magic skill:

*   Abbot
*   Cleric
*   Friar
*   Monk

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into the out of combat castable category as it contains buff spells for increasing resistances and no other types of spells.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Preservation magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._  

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose which spell line you wish to cast spells from. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Cast on me, lets you cast the spell on yourself.
*   Other, lets you choose who to cast the spell on if the spell can be cast on more than just you.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
