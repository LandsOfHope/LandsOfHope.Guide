A new feature has been added that allows scrapbook owners to place a scrapbook inside a museum.

On the Scrapbook Edit screen (the one that comes up when you use your Book of Wonder and select a Scrapbook) there is a button at the bottom of the screen to make a "Pedestal Scrapbook". Clicking this button will add a Pedestal Scrapbook to your Trade Bag. You can then go to a Museum room and place your Pedestal Scrapbook into the room using the Furnishing screen, once placed anyone who clicks on the Pedestal item will see your scrapbook.
