First, go to the tile that you want to build on. I reccomend it to be at least two tiles away from a town tile, because they are reserved.

When you have found a good location, go to your inventory and click on the deed. Click the **"Use"** button. This will place the building onto the tile.

Ok, enter the building and click on the **"Lock"** button to lock the building. Then only people on your building friends list and you will be able to get into the building.

To add people to your building friend list, click on the **"F"** button at the bottom of the screen. From there, you can add people to the list. Be sure to unban them after you add them. Also, on this screen, you can give people administrator and manager privileges.

To place items into your new building, first make sure that you have the required items. Then, while inside the building, click on the **"Furnish"** button. Then click the **"Item"** button on the middle bar. Then, click on the room in which you want to place the item.

A menu will appear on the right side of the window with a list of what items can be placed into the room. The items you have available in your inventory will show up in green. Click on the item in the list then click the **"Place"** button that will appear at the bottom of the list.

Now you have placed your first item in the building that you have just built. Congratulations and may all of your buildings be happy ones!
