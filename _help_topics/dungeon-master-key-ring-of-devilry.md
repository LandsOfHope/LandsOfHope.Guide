This gives you the ability to set monster spawns up to level 1515 (from level 1015) it also will allow the monsters to spawn with pets when the monster is over level 1200.

To use the item simply go to your normal spawn screen you will notice the level cap has automatically been increased to allow you to boost the levels to the new limit.
