The following changes have been made to the level 1000 realm called "Battlefield":

*   Every day is a DaD day in Battlefield, this means double PvP points for making Pvp kills. Although PvP is still optional in this realm and not necessary to complete sieging and any of the additional features listed below.
*   Monsters now come in three fruity flavors:
    *   Commanders, they have more money and much higher statsÂ and can drop a Sealed bag.
    *   General, they have more money and higher stats.
    *   Normal, the same flavor as always. Chewy and with a hint of raspberry!
*   All monsters excluding Commanders can now drop Battlefield orders, these are needed in a trophy quest.
*   Commanders now drop a Sealed bag, these can contain one of four things:
    *   Badge of command
    *   Battlefield orders
    *   A light snack for the road
    *   Nothing
*   A new NPC camp has been added at 15, 87 with a quest that requires 1000 battlefield orders, 100 badges of command and gives a super duper arttfact forehead item as a reward.
