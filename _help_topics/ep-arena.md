Monsters in EP have a 1 in 500 chance of dropping an Arena dungeon key, this key can be used to make an Arena dungeon.  
  

*   An Arena dungeon contains 5 or 6 rooms with tough monsters in each room, you have to fight through each room to get to the boss room once a room has been cleared no monster will respawn.
*   The boss room has a tougher still monster in it, defeating the boss monster will provide a chest with an item reward inside ...
*   These monster kills count towards your "Slayer Demon" title as the devourers once did ...
*   The key is non tradeable, the dungeon is only intended for your own use.
