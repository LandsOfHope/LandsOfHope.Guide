**Disable Experience**  
Checking this box will cause your experience to be disabled which will largely prevent you from gaining any experience. It is useful for people who wish to reach a certain level and go no higher or for people who wish to stop gaining experience so they stop levelling and can therefore raise their skills up to their current max without worrying about levelling up while they do so.

**Inventory Mode**  
This option allows you to configure the way the Inventory system sorts and orders itself. The options are as follows:

*   Game Default
*   Grouped by Item Type, Your inventory is grouped together with items in the same type  i.e. weapons are grouped with weapons.
*   Order by type and level, Your inventory is sorted by the type of item then the level of the item.
*   Grouped by type and level, Your inventory is grouped by type and then sorted by level.

**Private Skills**  
Checking this box will prevent you from showing up on screens that might otherwise let players use your skills to perform an action.

_For example when someone goes to the Appraisal NPC they get a list of people they wish to use to appraise an item, with this setting checked even if you have enough appraisal skill you will not show up on this screen._ 

Screens this option will prevent you from showing up on include:

*   Appraisal
*   Salvage
*   Locksmith
*   Crafting Marketeer

**Combat Taunting**  
Some classes gain the Taunting skill which can be used to cause monsters to specifically fight anyone using it over someone else in the fight. This means if you have a pet you can physically prevent the monster from attacking it while you are alive.

To turn this taunting mode on choose the Aggressive taunting option.
