The dungeon listing is predominantly fool proof and should be relatively accurate however there are a few things you may want to do to make it 100% accurate:

*   If your dungeon is to be aligned to a specific allegiance, make sure the entrance room has that alignment of monster spawn into it ... the code to say which allegiance a dungeon is simply checks the entrance room so if you have allegiance monsters further in but not at the entrance it will say your dungeon is neutral.
*   If you have a puzzle room in your dungeon but no puzzles it will say you have puzzles as it looks for the room rather than the puzzle item.
*   If you use dungeon pools it will not be able to accurately display the races so will just say "pooled spawns".
