**Island Capture Purpose**  
The point of Island capturing is to gain access to key resources, NPCs and eventually Paradise Island in the middle of the map.

*   Beachcombing, specific islands have specific resources this means it may be necessary to capture an island to access this resource.
*   NPCs, each of the smaller Islands have at least 1NPC on them, be it a trainer for Seamanship plans or a Routemaster.
*   Paradise Island, if you capture enough Islands your faction gains access to Paradise Island which has a full town as well as many useful NPCs.

**Island Capture Guide**  
To capture an Island you must defeat a fleet, this will give you a flag, you take the flag to the dungeon on the island the fleet is moored at then fight through the dungeon to turn the flag in, this will then unlock another island to access rather than the island you are currently at.

To begin with each faction has two islands which remain in their control 100% of the time, one of these islands has a mooring point and a dungeon on it and this is the starting point for your faction.

*   If you are in the **Myzan Navy** then the mooring for Squid Island can be found at 70, 78 with the dungeon at 66, 85.
*   If you are in the **Pirate League** then the mooring is at 30, 13 and the dungeon at 38, 12.

There is Â a diagram that I have created which shows the island capture path, you can view it at the following location:

The diagram shows each of the islands and uses arrows to outline the route each faction must take to capture all of the islands.
