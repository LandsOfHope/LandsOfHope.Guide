The **Stealth** skill is used to make yourself invisible, it is a handy skill for rogues and nefarious types to use so they can not be easily hunted or spotted while they perform questionable acts.

Stealth is a class skill available to the Rogue class, Stealth can also be used by other players via item bonus effects, spells and similar.

_While stealthed you may only be revealed by someone using the Detect Hidden skill, and they require as much in detect hidden as you have in Stealth to make you visible again._

**Skill Use  
**Open the Character > Info screen and click the Stealth button which can be found at the bottom of the screen. You may not be able to do everything you can unstealthed while stealthed.

You will notice when you stealth your picture in the top left corner of the game window turns translucent, this indicates you are currently stealthed.

This skill gives a **guaranteed skill gain** each time you stealth, raising the skill is fairly easy you may however find it easier to set up a Stealth/Unstealth shortcut using the Character > Shortcuts screen.

_Note: This skill does not give any experience when used._

**Formula**  
There is no particular formula for stealth, when you stealth your current stealth skill value determines your stealth effectiveness, which in turn determines how much Detect Hidden is needed to reveal you.

_i.e. Stealth with 50 skill and someone can unstealth you with 50 or more detect hidden skill._

Note: If you raise your Stealth skill by using items or spells after you stealthed the effect of the extra bonuses will not apply to your current stealthed rating until after you unstealth and re-stealth.

**Unstealthing**  
You may need to come out of stealth or remove stealth so you can stealth again if you are working on the skill. To unstealth use the Character > info screen and click the Unstealth button which is at the bottom of the screen in the same place the stealth button is usually.  
  
To unstealth use the Character > Info screen and click the Unstealth button.

**Detected using Detect Hidden**  
You may be discovered by people who have detect hidden skill, if someone reveals you then you will show up again and need to re-stealth.

_You will receive a message in your status window letting you know if someone has revealed you._
