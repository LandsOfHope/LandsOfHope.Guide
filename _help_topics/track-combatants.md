The **Track Combatants** skill provides the means to track players such as Gladiators (or anyone with PvP enabled). This skill is a class skill that can only be learnt via the Skill training deeds that Gladiators get as an evolution reward.

To track combatants after getting this skill use the World > Track > Combatants screen.

**Skill Use  
**Use World > Track > Combatants and it will show the screen you use to track pvp enabled players.

You can use the white arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to move the displayed view around, if you find something on the map you will gain a **purple skill gain**. This skill does not give experience as the reward of finding what you are looking for is intended to be reward enough.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Target Level \* 5)

_i.e. To track level 10 combatants you need 50 track combatants skill_

You can not track outside of your skill range so if you wish to track higher level pvpers than you currently have the skill for you will need to get items with bonuses on them for this tracking skill.
