There is now a way to get your listings on the marketeer to show up differently to draw attention to your items for sale.

You can buy Advertising paint using 10pp.

**Advertising paint**  
There are 6 different shades available as paint.

To purchase paint go to 32, 62 and enter the Market of Wonders, purchase 2 Golden tickets (that equates to 10pp) then go to the far west room and speak to the paint seller.

**General Tips**  
Only one color can be applied to an individual listing, when you trade the goods you wish to sell to your vendors the game will pick whatever color you have in your backpack (ignoring your chests/other bags) and apply it to the item(s) you traded. This means you can have one item use one color and another item use a different color if you are prepared to spend a little more time swapping paint out and trading stuff in small batches.

To remove a color you must take the item from the vendor, put your paint/supplies in bags then trade it back.

**Naming rooms/tiles**  
The enhanced listing this feature provides (along with the pretty colors) uses information based on the room the Player Vendor is in or the tile the Traveling Vendor is on (if it is an NPC rather than a Player Vendor).

So should you want pertinent information to show up on your listing you MUST name your tile something special as Grass will not sound very good on the listing, the same goes for your room naming something "Shop" is not gonna be very good while "Bobs Weapon Store" will sound a lot more impressive.

This feature also unlocks the ability for your shops to be found easier using the Enhanced shops button at the bottom of the marketeer, as well as ranking your goods above other players who do not have an enhanced listing.
