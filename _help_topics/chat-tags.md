To the right of a chatters name in chat there will sometimes be a tag, these tags are explained below.

**Rank Symbols**

*   Owner, The owner of Lands of Hope.
*   Admin, A Customer service manager, the next level down from the Owner. 
*   Mod, This person is a chat Moderator and responsible for enforcing the chat rules.
*   Helper, This person is a chat Helper and can answer questions (most people regardless of if they are a Helper will try to help new players and answer questions but these people with the Helper tag are official Helpers).

Also in some cases you may see "Servant" infront of someones name this indicates they are a new player and are playing on the Estate. Once the person leaves the Estate that prefix goes away.
