Portalstones are items that have been made using the Portal Mastery skill, while crafting a portalstone requires a skill the use of the stone itself does not. This means players are free to buy/trade/sell and use these stones as they see fit.

Portalstones provide an alternate way to travel, when you use a portalstone it creates a clickable but temporary item that lets you and anyone else that clicks on the portal access the destination the portalstone was bound to.

**Using a Portalstone from your Inventory  
**To use a Portalstone go to your Inventory > Containers screen, click on the portalstone in question and click the Use button.

_The actual portalstone item is not destroyed so you can continue to use it over and over again._

This will then open the portal and it will show up as either a building or world item depending on if you were inside or outside when you used it.

**Using the Open Portal screen**  
You can open portals to places near by if you have a portalstone by either using them as listed above or by using the World > Open Portal screen.

You may find it more convenient to use the open portal screen if you have a lot of portalstones or can\`t remember where a portalstone is bound to as it provides a graphical map of the portalstones you have in your inventory.

You can use the white arrow buttons to move the displayed view around and if you wish to open a portal click on the portal destination.

_Using a portalstone does not get you any experience nor does it involve skill gains to any skill._
