They are similar to Battered Chests but not the same, these boxes have 3 items inside while a battered chest has two.

When an Apprentice - Artisan uses the safety deposit box they will get three random resources (in quantities of 20), when all other classes use the box they will get three items from the usual battered chest pool.
