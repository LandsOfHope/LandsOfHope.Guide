First, look through the different building plans in **Library > Items > Plans > Construction** to see what type of building you want. Once you find one, click on the "**Craft Info**" button to see what materials are needed to build it.   
Next, gather or buy those materials.  
Then go to the Marketeer, click the "**Craft**" tab. In the search bar, put the name of the plan you want to build and hit enter.  
After that, click on components. There will be two lists.  The one on the right is what is needed for the plan, and on the left are listed the components you possess. Select from your materials and click on the ones you need.   
Then click **Build.**  
After that, select a person from the list that will pop up to build it, then click **ok**. It will then be in your queue.   
When it finishes, move it to your inventory.
