I have created two flyers for advertising the game at locations where you all are permitted to post flyers in the dun dun dun REAL WORLD (yes it does exist! I saw photos of it once!).  
  
The first flyer is a generic one intended for people to use if they are not interested in referrals.  
  
The second flyer is one that allows you to write (yes with a pen) your referral ID so perhaps you get some referrals if someone signs up.  
  
Both are in PDF format.
