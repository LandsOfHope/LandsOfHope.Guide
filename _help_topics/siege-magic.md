The **Siege Magic** skill is a special skill that is available from performing a quest in Fenwood Town (Sanydale Basin map). This skill determines what magic spells you can learn and cast in siege combat.

Siege magic spells are for combat alone and can not be cast outside of combat at all.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Siege magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._

**Casting a siege spell**  
You can cast damage spells in siege combat in two different ways.

*   Click the cast offensive spell button
*   Click the cast readied offensive spell button

To cast a readied spell you must have first readied the spell, to do this go to the Abilities > Ready Spells screen and choose the spells you wish to ready.

To cast any spell in combat you need two main things:

*   Intelligence, this determines which spells you can cast regardless of how much mana you have.
*   Mana, mana is consumed when you cast spells you can only cast a spell if you have enough mana to do so.

After casting a spell you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
