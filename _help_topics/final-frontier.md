A new content pack was added on Friday 6th August 2010 that contains more things for level 900 - 1000+ to do.

The pack contains both sieging, crafting tasks and of course fighting and is open all allegiances INCLUDING neutral.

You can access the Final Frontier by visiting the Citadel in the Royal Hollow on or after level 900 and using the Portal on the ground.

Once inside the Final Frontier you can gather Patches from map spawning Allegiance monsters, Keys from them as well and use these to complete turn in quests.

Only Fighters/Siegers can do the siege relating tasks to capture keeps, and then fight through the keep dungeon to reach the special Artifact the Keep contains to capture it for their allegiance.

**Keep Bonuses**

*   0 - 1 Keeps (Your own keep) - Nothing
*   1+ Keeps -1s Crafting bonus (applied to most but not yet all crafting skills) for your allegiance.
*   2+ Keeps - +10% Legend Dungeon Artifact plan drop rate for your allegiance.

Tip: Do the quests at 50, 50 in FF realm to get a Key to go to your Allegiance Town.to begin with, you can then take additional quests.
