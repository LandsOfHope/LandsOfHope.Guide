There are two contests in the game that players can enter, one happens in March and is called the "Best Building" contest. While the other happens in September and is called the "Best Dungeon" contest.

Both of these contests involve a player submitting their building or their dungeon to the competition screen (accessible via the Competitions link on the website or via [http://www.forlornonline.com/competitions.asp](competitions.asp)).

The contest runs for one full month, after that month is up Decius will judge all of the entires and pick the winners.
