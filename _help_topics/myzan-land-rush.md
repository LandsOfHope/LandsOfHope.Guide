Once a year at an as yet unfixed date/timet there will be a Myzan Land Rush, now some of you may be asking why this is necessary when you can already own land.

The idea is that once a year one special auction will be held using real money instead of game money, the winner of this auction will gain a wonderful reward a set of up to 5 specially designed tiles.

Winner receives:

*   An island or land mass in a realm of their choosing up to five tiles.
    *   Custom terrain colors and imagery as required.
    *   Custom tile names.
*   One NPC populated town at a level range relevant to the realm using the Springlade layout.
    *   Custom town name.
    *   Up to three special trophy quests using an NPC either in the town or on one of the five tiles won.
*   One NPC dungeon populated with monsters relevant to the realm level and using a theme based on the winning bidders requirements.
    *   One boss monster.
    *   Trophy quests linked to the NPC in town.
    *   Up to two dungeon levels.

As you can see this is truly a most amazing prize and won well worthy of your bidding, to enable the maximum amount of people to bid on this auction it will be held in a new chat channel and conducted live!

The first Myzan Land Rush will take place at **1pm ET (6pm GMT) on Saturday 9th August**, please note this auction will be using real money this means that payment will be required based on your winning bid within 7days of the auction ending, if payment is not forthcoming the second highest bidder will win and payment will be expected from them within 7days.

**Bidding Tips**

*   Set yourself a maximum price you are willing to pay before the auction starts. Then do not exceed it ...
*   Only bid if you know you have the money to cover your bids, fraudulent bidders will have their cookie priviledges taken away and will be locked in a room with no cookies to the end of time!
