The armor skill represents your ability to absorb damage, while most races and professions start with a tiny amount of natural armor the bulk of your **ARMOR** rating will come from wearing items and using Abilities or Spells.  
  
Having high armor will improve your chances of absorbing more damage from an enemy.  
  
**Formula**  
Damage Absorbed = (ARMOR / 10)  
  
This means for every 10 points in this skill you absorb 1pt of physical damage.  
  
_The DEFENSE series of skills are used in addition to this skill to determine how much damage is absorbed in combat._
