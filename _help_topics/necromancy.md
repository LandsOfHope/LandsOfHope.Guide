The **Necromancy** skill is a class skill that the Necromancer class gets. This skill has two main uses:

*   Casting Necromancy spells
*   Taming Undead monsters

_As with the other taming skills you can also use bonuses on items to acquire this skill although it is unlikely you will be able to tame very high level monsters doing it that way. **However you can not learn magic spells without knowing the skill naturally**._

For a complete list of necromancy spells check out the Library > Spells listing.

**Taming Skill Use**  
To enslave an undead you must first find one, if you have the Track Undeads skill you can use that to find one or you can simply rely on coming across one by chance.

When you move the mouse over a monster it will tell you its classification in the middle of the screen so it is fairly simple to spot undeads it will also list how much skill and what skill is needed to control this particular monster.

If you have enough skill simply click the button marked Control in the middle bank of buttons after selecting the monster. This will tame the pet and make it available to you on the Minions > Manage screen, you will gain a **purple skill gain** and some experience for taming.

_By default you have a total of 4 pet slots, this is broken down as 1 pet in stables and 3 pets out of stables. You can purchase additional pet slots via the File > Buy Extras > Enhancements screen._

**Formula**  
Skill required = (Monster Level \* 5)

_i.e. To tame a level 100 monster you need 500 skill._

**Necromancy Spells  
**The necromancy line of magic has three main spell types:

*   Damage spells, these can be used in combat and give a **purple skill gain**.
*   Drain spells, these can be used in combat and give a **purple skill gain**.
*   Summon spells, these are cast outside of combat via the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Visit the relevant spell trainer to learn the spells you are interested in. You should use the Help > Manual > Realm Name screens to locate the necromancy spell trainer that teaches spells in the required skill range.

**Envoker Use**  
The necromancer can summon special items via a series of spells, these items are called Envokers and allow the necromancer to create a special pet.

Use the Abilities > Spellbook screen to summon an envoker then use the Inventory > Containers screen to use the envoker and create your pet.
