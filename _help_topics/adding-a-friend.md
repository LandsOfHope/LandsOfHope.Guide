To add another character as a friend in the game go to the Character > Friends screen, click on the Add Friend button at the bottom of the screen.

You will then be presented with a search screen to find the person you wish to add to your friends list.

*   Find - Used to find a friend out of all of the characters in the game (logged in or not) and use a search word to limit the list to specific people.
*   Current Tile - Displays a list of people on the same tile as you and lets you add them as friends.
*   Guild - Displays a list of people in your guild and lets you add them as friends.
*   Fellowship - Displays a list of people in your fellowship and lets you add them as friends.

So to add a friend simply type the name of the friend into the search box and click find, then click on the match (if a matching person is found) and they will now be added to your friend list and show up on Character > Friends.
