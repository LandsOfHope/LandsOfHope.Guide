Sometimes you may need help from someone in chat who is a Helper or Moderator, to aid them in better assisting you it may be necessary for them to look at your character information because not everyone would appreciate their character information being reviewed these Helpers/Mods have a command they can use that will send you a button allowing you to authorize them to VIEW (THEY HAVE NO POWERS TO CHANGE ANY INFORMATION) your Inventory, Stats and basic information such as Name, Profession and Level.

This tool is intended only as an aid to help the helpers help you and can only be used by them on your character if you authorize it, so if you do not feel comfortable with the Helper looking at your character simply REFUSE the request.

This feature also only works on Characters up to level 100 so as to prevent unnecessary requests to Helpers for players wanting their gear to be inspected/reviewed for uberness when we already have the Character link system for that.

If you feel that a Helper is abusing this command please contact [support@landsofhope.com](mailto:support@landsofhope.com) / Decius immediately and explain what you think they are abusing.
