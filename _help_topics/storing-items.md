As you journey around Myzan you will collect countless amounts of items the vast majority of these will probably only be useful for selling to an NPC but some of them may be important or worthy of keeping.

If you do decide to keep an item there are a number of ways you can store it to keep it safe.

**Bags/Inventory  
**Keep the item in your inventory use the Inventory > Actions > Flags screen to turn off the items Trade/Sell and Drop flags so you don\`t accidentally drop it or sell it.

You could also make a small/largeÂ bag your keepsake bag and keep all the items you do not wish to get rid of inside that bag, this would make it highly unlikely you would accidentally drop or sell such an item.

**Storage Chests/Crates**  
Such items can be placed into buildings and offer unlimited storage potential.

_Crates are generally public which means anyone who can access that room can use the crate so be careful if you make a room public as you may find you lose whatever you place inside a crate._

Storage chests can be secured however anyone who is on the room friend list can open a storage chest which means anyone you trust enough to add to the friends list can open your chest.

If a storage chest is not secured then anyone who can access the room can open it in the same way you can open a crate.

**Player/Pet Mule**  
You can use a pet or player as a storage mule if you don\`t mind using up one of your pet or character slots with something you probably will never play.

You can trade your items to a pet using the Minions > Manage screen (Trade Button) or to a player using the standard trade button.

_Important: If you are using a player as a mule please level the player up to at least level 5 as the player may be deleted as part of maintenance if it is level 1._

**Vault**  
Storage vaults can be found in major towns such as Springlade they may also be present on player owned tiles and players can place them inside a vault room inside a building they own.

Storage vaults are 100% secure but you are limited in terms of storage capacity as each storage vault is exactly the same the contents of the vault is linked across all vaults so opening a vault in one town will show you the contents of your vault which includes items placed into the vault from other locations too.

_Vaults are 100% secure and can not be broken into so these are the most secure forms of storage in the game._
