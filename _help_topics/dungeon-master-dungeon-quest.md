It is now possible for Dungeon Masters to setup a single quest for use in their dungeon. The type of quest is based loosely on the trophy quest system so it is used to make item recovery type quests.

This feature allows you to specify the name of the quest, and the name of the item that will be used in the quest and to pick a picture that will be used from about 30 different stock images in use in the game. You can also enter a quest teaser/description which explains the backstory to the quest.

The reward for completing such a quest in a dungeon is a "super dungeon token".

**How to configure a dungeon quest?**  
Firstly enter your DM dungeon, then click on **Manage your dungeon** button as you would normally do to add rooms.

At the bottom of the screen click on **Quest Setup**, this will open a new screen that should initially be pretty devoid of life aside from the boxes you will use to enter your quest information.

These boxes are:

*   Quest Name - The name of the quest i.e. "Deccy\`s Chocolate Egg Hunt"
*   Item Name - The name of the item that will be dropped i.e. "Deccy\`s Chocolate Egg" - Please also choose a picture on the right of the screen when entering your item name.
*   Difficulty - This box chooses the amount of items the person must find for the quest to complete, the minimum amount is 5 and given these items have a 1% drop rate that could take days if not weeks ... although a lucky person might do it in hours.
*   Quest Text - This box is where you enter the story to the quest for example "Deccy has made a batch of Chocolate eggs and hidden them in this dungeon, there are 5 eggs to get. Come back when you have gained all five ..."

Click Save to save these fields and create your quest, you can then edit them as you see fit!

**Deleting a Quest or Changing the Item**  
These drop items are tied to the dungeon rather than the quest, this means if you delete the quest and make a new one any old items a player got in the dungeon for an old quest you made will still work for the new quest.

Note: Dropped items from one players dungeon will not work in another players dungeon!

**Completing the Quest  
**You must build a "Quest Room" in your dungeon using Dungeon Mastery skill, this room can have a "Quest Box" added to it,Â a player then clicks on the Box and hands over the items and completes the quest. These quests are always repeatable.
