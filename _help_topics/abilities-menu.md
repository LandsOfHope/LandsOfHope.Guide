The Abilities menu contains the following items:

**Styles**  
Opens the Styles screen which gives you a list of all of the combat styles you know. Combat styles are used in conjunction with weapons and weapon skills to deal additional damage in combat, infact combat styles do a considerable amount of damage and are a valuable asset to any fighter class.

**Ready Styles**  
Opens the Ready styles screen which allows you to ready a style or unready a style. A readied style can be used faster than an unreadied style as you can use the readied style button in combat to have the game pick the best available readied style you can use. In this way readying styles is a valuable way to make combat faster and involve less button clicking.

_You can have up to twenty spells / styles readied at any one time._

**Spellbook  
**Opens the Spellbook screen which gives you a list of all of the spells you currently know, this includes both combat and non-combat spells. This screen can also be used to cast any spells that might work outside of combat so you can use it to cast buffs and heal spells (amongst others).

**Ready Spell  
**Opens the ready spell screen which allows you to ready spells for use in combat or to unready a previously readied spell. Readying a spell allows you to cast spells faster than if the spell was unreadied as you can click the readied spell button and have the game use the best spell available.

_You can have up to twenty spells / styles readied at any one time._

**Active**  
Opens the Active spell screen which lists all of the active spell effects including beneficial spells, traps and mount bonuses. You can use this screen to review the effects and to see when the spell will expire and also in limited cases you can cancel spells too.

**Allegiance  
**Opens the Allegiance spells screen which allows you to activate and cast any spells or bonus effects your allegiance has earnt through the level 1000 Battlefield realm.
