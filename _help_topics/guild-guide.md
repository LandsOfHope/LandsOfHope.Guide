This guide is intended to explain what a guild is, as a guild is such a common term used in every RPG ever made since before humans evolved out of primordial sludge (or were put on the earth by our maker) I had assumed this topic was not necessary but it seems that it is better to write it and have it than to not write it and need it so here goes.

Essentially a guild is a collection of players/people with like minded beliefs/views and a common thread joining them together.

Guilds can be specific to a particular aspect of the game such as a Rogue only guild or a Tamers only guild (by guild master design) or they can be for anyone to join.

**What do you get out of a guild?**  
Once in a guild you will notice that fellow guild members show up differently in the game and that you will see guild titles under a guild member\`s name instead of their class title.

Guilds generally offer a way for you to make and meet new friends who have like minded interests. Guilds can also provide a safe haven in terms of a Guild home that all guild members can share.

Guilds also come with their own sets of rewards, such as the Guild colors.  

You also will get access to the Guilds > Messages system where you can leave messages for other members and communicate with guild members.

Guilds are not intended for single players, although it is possible for a guild to contain only one player. It is intended that guilds be used by lots of people, as that is where the fun comes in!

Note: There are more topics on the management side of running a guild that can be accessed via the help system.
