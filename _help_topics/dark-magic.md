The **Dark Magic** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the dark line of magic.

The following playable classes get the dark magic skill:

*   Dark Lord

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into the first category as dark magic contains purely damage based spells.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Dark magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._  

**Casting a damage spell**  
You can cast damage spells in combat in two different ways.

*   Click the cast offensive spell button
*   Click the cast readied offensive spell button

To cast a readied spell you must have first readied the spell, to do this go to the Abilities > Ready Spells screen and choose the spells you wish to ready.

To cast any spell in combat you need two main things:

*   Intelligence, this determines which spells you can cast regardless of how much mana you have.
*   Mana, mana is consumed when you cast spells you can only cast a spell if you have enough mana to do so.

After casting a spell you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
