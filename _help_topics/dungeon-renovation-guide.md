As a dungeon owner (dungeon mastery dungeons)Â you have a myriad of different options available to you to make your dungeon look and feel unique.

Customisation options include:

*   Changing the name of the dungeon
*   Changing the name and description of rooms
*   Changing room images
*   Changing room preview images
*   Changing room background colors
*   Furnishing your rooms
*   Adding spawns
*   Adding portals
*   Locking rooms and making keys for rooms.

The majority of these actions are performed through the central renovation screen which can be accessed by entering the dungeon in question and clicking the administer button at the bottom of the screen.

The renovate screen is designed in such a way to allow you to use a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) style interface which means you can see many of the changes you make as you make them.

The renovate screen provides an overhead view of your entire dungeon that can be navigated using both the floor number buttons at the top of the screen (if your dungeon has multiple floors) and the white arrow buttons for moving around the dungeon layout along the X and Y axis.

When you click on a room via the renovate map the right side of the screen will update to display a screen based on the action mode you have selected.

The action modes perform the following functions:

*   **Edit**, this mode allows you to change the room name and description.
*   **Keys**, this mode allows you to make keys to various rooms.
*   **Image**, this mode allows you to set the layer 1 and layer 2 room images.
*   **Preview**, this mode allows you to set the room preview image.
*   **Build**, this mode allows you to use a room deed to expand or update your rooms.
*   **Spawn Key**, this mode allows you to place a key you made using the Keys action into a room to make it an item visitors can collect on the ground.
*   **Portal**, this mode allows you to make portals between two locations in your dungeon.
*   **Items**, this mode allows you to add furnishing items to your rooms.
*   **Color**, this mode allows you to change the background color of a room.
*   **Delete**, this mode allows you to delete a room or dungeon.

If you make a lot of changes you may find it more convenient to exit the dungeon once the changes are complete and re-enter the building to have the mini-map update.
