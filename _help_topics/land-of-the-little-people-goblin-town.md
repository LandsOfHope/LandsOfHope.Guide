Goblin Town was added in July 2009 as part of the 4th Anniversary celebrations. Implemented into the game over the course of several weeks in "short" segments that could be completed individually or as a whole.

To begin these quests go to 29, 53 and enter Goblin Town.

After reaching the NPC at the end of the short dungeon he will tell you his story and ask for your help, if you decide to help you will be set a number of challenges and be able to use a special item the "Super Shrinker" to travel to weird and wonderful locations to fulfill the NPCs desire.
