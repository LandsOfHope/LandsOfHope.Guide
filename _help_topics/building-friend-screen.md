The building friend screen is used to set a list of people who are allowed access to a building or room.

The friend screen can be accessed either via the Friend button on the Property > Manage screen or via the friend button found at the bottom of the screen when inside a building room.

The Add screen will list all of the people at the current location by default but you can also put the name of someone into the box at the top of the screen to have it search for someone to add to the list of friends.

To confirm adding someone to this rooms friends list click on their name in the results area of the window and then you will be taken back to the friends screen to edit the user. _See editing a friend above._

**Friend Colors**  
Friends show up in one of three colors:

*   **Green**, this is a friend you added to the list.
*   **Red**, this is someone who is on your friends list but banned which means they can not enter this room.
