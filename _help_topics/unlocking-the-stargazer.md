To unlock the Stargazer profession for your account you must get one of your characters to level 1000 then go speak to Astronomer Shimmer at 50, 50 in the Eternal Plains realm.

After unlocking the profession you can make as many Stargazers as you want, and pick and choose the constellations to suit you.
