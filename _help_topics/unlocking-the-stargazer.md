To unlock the Stargazer profession for your account you must do one of the following two things:

*   Get one of your characters to level 1000 then go speak to Astronomer Shimmer at 50, 50 in the Eternal Plains realm.
*   Alternatively you can purchase this as a bought extra profession for 20USD/4HC via the Buy Extras link on your account screen.

If you pay to unlock the profession you can still do the quest at a later date but it will not unlock the profession again.

After unlocking the profession you can make as many Stargazers as you want, and pick and choose the constellations to suit you.
