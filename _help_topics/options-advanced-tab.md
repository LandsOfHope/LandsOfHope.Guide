**Default crafting dest. bag  
**You can use this option to set which bag (backpack or sellbag) items you craft via the Inventory > Tradeskill menu will end up going to.

**Disable gathering bonus items**  
When you use some gathering skills there is a chance you may gain a random item as well as whatever you are trying to gather.

_For example when you gather ore you may also receive a gem as a bonus._

You can disable this feature by ticking the box.

**Refuse special post**  
Players can use a post master NPC to send items to other players, if you do not wish to receive items via the post from strangers you can tick this box to disable it. Note: _You may still receive items from people on your friends list as they can use free post to send to you._

**Identified items go to Sell Bag**  
When you identify an item using the appraisal skill it will go to your backpack unless you have this option ticked, with this option ticked it will go to your sell bag.

**No Outside Spawns**  
If you just wish to explore or gather resources without having to worry about monsters spawning you can tick this option. This setting will disable monster spawns when traveling around the world map which may make travel faster as well.

**Display NPC messages**  
Ticking this box will disable certain NPC interaction messages.

**Use advanced prompts**  
To preserve a more consistent feel the standard functions for Msgboxes and Inputboxes that Javascript and VBScript provide have been replaced with a custom series of boxes which preserve the look and feel of the rest of the game screens. You can disable those advanced boxes here by ticking the box, it may be necessary to turn them off if you have high internet security or a script blocker that blocks popups.

**How should the bars be displayed**  
You can choose to display graphical or text bars for your HP/MP/SP bars. Also you can choose to display either your mana or stamina bar below your health bar.  
  
Note: Changing this setting will require your game window to be refreshed.
