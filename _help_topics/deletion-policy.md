To try to keep the size of the game database to a minimum we operate the following deletion policies:

**Free Accounts**

*   Characters on an accountÂ not played within 60 days are deleted, to prevent this simply log in at least once every 60 days (or pay for the game).
*   Characters that are level 1 and have not gained any experience are deleted as part of our tutorial cleanup, it is assumed that if you are level 1 with no experience you quit the game and didnt like it.

**Paid Accounts**

*   Characters are not deleted, if you are on a paid or courtesy account your character is safe.
*   NEW: To help keep the Inventory system in check (there are currently over 600,000 individual items in peoples inventory) we will now be enforcing a new policy that deletes items in the sell bag/storage containers and trade bags if the account has not been played in longer than a year. Items in the bank vault, equipped or in your backpack / equipped bags are left alone.

The majority of people that stop playing for as long as a year are not going to come back which is unfortunate, but it seems unfair to the people that do play actively to keep inventory space in use that could be better placed elsewhere.

**Banned Accounts  
**If you are banned from the game your characters may be deleted prior to the usual 60 days given to free accounts, this is because you can not access the game so your characters do not need to be on the server. Most bans if we ever get as far to give you a game ban are permanent and only in extremely exceptional cases will you be allowed back.
