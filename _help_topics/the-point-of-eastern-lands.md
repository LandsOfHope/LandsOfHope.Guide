Earlier drafts of the pack had the 5 factions being at war, I felt that we had already kind of done that to death with the challenges and the UW pack soÂ I decided against it .... I wouldn't say the 5 factions are bestest friends and have human roasting BBQ's every weekend but they do respect each other and are not openly at war.

Essentially the five different factions all have different rewards and different special powers in dragon combat, so when you choose a side you are really choosing how you act in combat. You should have read the other topic I made on the powers each faction gets before choosing a side as there is no "undo" button so you have to be 100% sure it is the right side for you.

As with other faction based content, you earn faction points by completing tasks and killing enemy monsters ... hunting monster dragons in the other factions provides a nice amount of fame and trophy items to turn in for rewards.

The goal of the pack is simply to provide additional content, new items and the ability to experience dragons and combat in a new way than before. This pack will not be for everyone, infact some of you may hate it with a passion ... however those that like dragons and change may find it extremely enjoyable.
