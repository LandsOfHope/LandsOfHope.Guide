The guild messages screen can be accessed via the Guilds > Messages menu. The screen is intended as the standard way for guild members to communicate with each other.

It can be used for the following:

*   Guild announcements
*   Greetings and welcome messages
*   Chit chat
*   and anything else you can think of.

The screen has the following options:

*   **Subject**, The topic for this post.
*   **Announcement**, Ticking this box will make the message stay at the top of the message listing and increase its visibility.
*   **Message**, The actual message that you are posting.
*   **Broadcast**, This is an optional feature for use by game owners predominantly. When posting a new message if the message is important enough to require people to read it as a priority you can type a small note in this box and that message will be sent to everyone in your guild as a reminder. i.e. _you could enter something like "Important guild meeting tomorrow at 5pm check the Guilds > Messages screen for more information"_.

**Viewing a message**  
To view a message simply click on it on the Messages screen.

The view message screen displays a message and all replies in chronological order with the oldest/first post at the top.

_If you need to send a message to a postee you can click the PM button to the right of the view message listing to send them a private message._

If you have admin permissions you can delete posts by checking the check box to the right of each message and then clicking the Delete button at the bottom of the screen. All of the selected messages will then be deleted.
