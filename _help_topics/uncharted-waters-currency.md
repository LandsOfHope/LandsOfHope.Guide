Originally the plan was to have 4 new currencies, I was going to use pennies, shillings, crowns and doubloons and a realistic conversion rate for them ... however I think that system would be too complicated for a lot of people to figure out so I have ditched the four currencies in favor of one.

Doubloons is now the currency of choice, as there are no multi-tiered currency like there is in the non-expansion pack realms it pretty much means that people will be able to accrue massive amounts of doubloons, possibly in the millions or more ...

The currency in uncharted waters is non-transferrable, you can not trade it with other players and you can not transfer it into gold, silver, bronze etc .... it is unique to that realm.
