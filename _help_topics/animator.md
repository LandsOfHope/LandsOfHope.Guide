Allowed Armor: **Cloth  
**The Animator class has the following weapon skills to choose from:

*   Fists
*   Two-Handed Staves

You will get a stave automatically (if you do the Combat quest) you can also craft your own or buy weapons from General Store NPCs dotted around the lands of Myzan. The Animator class has weakened combat stats, while it can still deal some damage with the right gear, weapons and styles its main offensive ability is the use of Golems crafted using the Animation skill.

Attack Power: Average  
Magic Power: Average  
Armor: Average  
Health: Average

**Fighting**  
After you have done the Training - Combat quest you will have gained a stave, this section of the guide will focus on the use of the Stave in your Estate Supply Box.

As with all weapons making sure you have the best stave for your level will ensure you do optimum damage, there are new materials generally every 5 levels so you should be able to upgrade your stave every five levels, however there are not NPC shops every five levels so you may have to trade with other players or kill monsters or craft the items yourself to obtain them. The higher the level of the item the greater its DPR (Damage per round) rating and thus how much damage it can do.

After equipping your stave enter combat and click the Attack button and you will swing at the enemy.

**Golems**  
The Animator class is not a super strong fighter on its own, its weak armor and low health and strength does not make it suited to combat, that is where your golem pet comes in. The animator class can use golems (special pets) which have higher stats/skills than normal pets to create a formiddable fighting force in combat.

Golems default to having taunting turned on and will take all of the hits a monster can give, they may still die like any pet but then an Animator can bring a golem back to life with a special Golem only spell.

As well as making golems you can also buff them using your special magic line called Reformation.

**Crafting Golems (after you leave the Estate)**  
The Animator class is unique due to its special golem pets, these are crafted using the Animation skill which this class starts with, although you will need to get some plans for the skill once you leave the estate.

Golems require a number of parts and processes in order to be completed, the basic core components of a golem are manufactured using gems and/or stone blocks which can be gathered using geology or mining.

You will come to notice that when you combine your golem together the level of the golem varies, the level is in fact based on the level of the main golem component you used which is based on the "shell" component. In this way you should always be able to make the right level golem if you have the right level resources at hand.

Incase you werent aware the main ingredient in crafting, usually shows up in bold text or in gold text and it is the ingredient that determines the final level of the item you are making, so if you use a level 10 ingot in your sword you get a level 10 sword the level of the other ingredients doesnt matter you can use level 1 materials for those which is why you only need to have trained the other skills to be able to make the weapons yourself.

**Future Choices  
**As an Animator, at level 50 you can evolve into a Shaper which will allow you to create a wider variety of golems.

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.
