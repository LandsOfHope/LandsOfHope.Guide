The Salvager is melee orientated with the use of the following skills:

*   Crossbow
*   Fists
*   Shields
*   Swords

Like the Rogue and Fighter classes the Salvager can also dual wield weapons which enables a Salvager to wield a weapon in both hands and do more damage over time. The Salvager class starts with the ability to use Leather as well as Cloth which puts it on an even footing with the other starter melee classes.

**Fighting  
**After you have done the Training - Combat quest you will have gained some weapons, this section of the guide will focus on the use of the Shield and Sword in your Estate Supply Box rather than other weapons, although the information can be applied to most weapons.

As a salvager you can dual wield weapons, so you should equip both the shield and sword, dual wielding does not make you do twice as much damage as people who wield one weapon but it does make it so that your secondary weapon (right hand) is used randomly in combat giving you an added boost over someone using a one handed weapon.

As with all weapons making sure you have the best Shield and Sword for your level will ensure you do optimum damage, there are new materials generally every 5 levels so you should be able to upgrade your weapons every five levels, however there are not NPC shops every five levels so you may have to trade with other players or kill monsters or craft the items yourself to obtain them. The higher the level of the item the greater its DPR (Damage per round) rating and thus how much damage it can do.

After equipping your weapons, you can attack with them in combat. To attack an enemy in combat click the Attack button and you will swing at them.

**Salvaging**  
The Salvager and latter evolutions gain a passive ability that allows them to gain additional money from monsters after defeating them in combat.

This ability is applied automatically when you go to loot the money on the loot screen so you do not have to do anything special to access it.

This ability can also be used to salvage additional items and loot from monsters to do this click the Salvage button on the loot screen.

_The monster is destroyed when you click the button so make sure you have removed any items of loot you wished to keep._

**Future Choices  
**As a Salvager at level 50 you can evolve into an Adventurer.

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.
