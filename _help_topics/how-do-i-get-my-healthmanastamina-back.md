There are three ways to regenerate, pick your preferred method or mix and match as required.

*   World > Rest, move the mouse up to the World menu then when it drops down click on Rest. You will then stand a good chance of regenerating your health/mana and stamina to full unless a random encounter prevents you. Can only be used out of combat.
*   Eating food, go to the inventory > Actions > Consume screen and choose the food to consume you can regenerate health, mana or stamina depending on the food you are eating and you can buy food from an Inn or make it yourself with Cooking skill. You can also consume food in combat using the item button in the combat screen.
*   Spells, some classes get self or targetable heal spells these can either be case via the Abilities > Spellbook screen out of combat or used via the Heal spell button in combat.

The fastest, easiest and less costly method of resting is World > Rest but you are free to find your favourite way of resting.
