The **Beast Breeding** skill is a class skill that the Beastlord and Beastmaster classes gain access to (Archer evolutions). The skill is used to breed two of your **beast** pets together to make a new pet.

**Skill Use**  
To breed two pets they must both be beasts, also some races and professions can not be bred due to the fact they are special rewards or intended to be rare.

Use the Minions > Breeding > Beast Breeding menu to access the breeding screen for beasts. As you will likely see there are options for breeding insects and plants but that is done through a different skill.

To breed you will need either a male and female pet or a male/female and unisex pet.

_You can not breed two pets of the same sex._

You will notice the screen is split into three distinct columns:

1.  The left column is called the primary column and determines the end race your pet will be bred as.
2.  The middle column is the secondary column and determines the profession your pet will be bred as.
3.  The right column displays information on the breeding process and lets you adjust the level of the pet you will make.

The level of the pet you make can be adjusted via the -/+ button with the max level decided based on the combined level of the two parents divided by two.

Breeding uses a queue system but one that is outside of the inventory queue system. This means breeding pets will not affect your ability to craft items and vice versa.

Use the Minions > Breeding > Breeding Queue screen to finish the breeding process and hatch your pet.

**Formula  
**Skill required = (Max Parent Level \* 5)

The amount of skill required to breed two pets is based on the highest level parent, so if you have a level 1000 parent and a level 500 parent the skill required will be 1000.
