The **Traps** skill is a class skill that Hunters and Trackers get, it can be used to construct elaborate traps which can be placed on map tiles or inside rooms. These traps have to be disarmed before someone can pass and if the trap is triggered they may die to its effects.

**Skill Use  
**Use the Inventory > Tradeskill > Traps screen, it lists all of the traps you have the skill to make with the most potent traps at the top of the screen.

_Unlike many of the tradeskills you do not need to buy plans or spells they will automatically become available as your skill rises._

Traps are made using the queue system once you queue a trap use the Inventory > Queue screen to complete the trap and gain any experience you may be due.

You will gain a **purple skill gain** for each trap you make.

**Trap Use**  
Traps currently have several uses:

*   Placing on a tile or inside a room
*   Used as an offensive item in combat

**Placing Traps**  
You can have one trap in use inside a building and one trap in use on a tile.Â Traps can be placed by going to the location or room you wish to use the trap on and opening your Inventory screen then choosing the trap and clicking the use button.

You will find that there are some restrictions on trap placement that prevent you from placing traps everywhere for example you can not place a trap that is higher level than the tile or room.

_This is to prevent level 1 players on a level 1 tile having to deal with a level 1000 trap which would be extremely frustrating._

After a trap is placed you will receive a message when someone triggers the trap which will let you know if they died or lived through it. Placing a trap does not give any experience or skill gains.

**Combat Traps**  
Traps can be used in combat by clicking the Use combat offensive item button on the fight screen. Using a trap is the equivalent of casting a spell on your target so if the trap is successful you may deal a reasonable amount of damage in the fight simply from traps.
