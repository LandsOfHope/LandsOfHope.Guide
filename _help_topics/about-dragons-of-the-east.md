Dragons of the East (Eastern Promise - during pre-release) is the third expansion to Lands of Hope, after Jurassic Wars and Uncharted Waters.

This pack takes Asian/Oriental themes and Dragons as its core gameplay content, the pack content is accessible by any existing character and there is no new class or profession to play in this pack.

After you enter the realm with a character you are encouraged/required to join one of the 5 different factions in this realm.

Note: Make sure you have looked into the rewards and powers that come with each faction before choosing as there is no undo button so once chosen you are stuck with your choice forever.

After choosing a side you will be able to go to that sides "base of operations" via a teleporter, although you can also get there via the World > Landmarks screen.

You may not fight in this realm until you pick a side, and while each side is not necessarily at war with each other the members of one side will not talk with the members of another.

You will find that in this realm your equipment and pets from the other realms are irrelevant as combat does not invovle such things, after you join a side you are mated with the beastial power of that sides Dragon and this is where you get all of your combat prowess from ... there is a totalyl new combat system for fighting in this realm and everything you fight will use it. The combat system revolves around your faction and your faction fame, the higher your fame the more abilities you can use and the higher your stats, however the dragon gods are cruel and have seen to it that as your fame goes up so shall your enemies and as such you will find yourself fighting harder monsters.

As stated above you can not use pets in combat, they have no place here as they are not tied to the dragon factions, and even if you had an ordinary dragon you would find it does not work here because it is not allied with these factions ... so while you can bring pets into this realm they will likely stand around waiting for somethign nasty to eat them instead of helping you.

You may gain a pet as a reward from some quests in this realm, these pets will not work in dragon combat either but will work in normal combat when you leave the realm.
