The Salvager bought extra class line consists of the following classes.

*   Salvager
*   Adventurer
*   Treasure Hunter
*   Archaeologist

None of these professions get "magic" they are purely melee based, the salvager starts with Crossbows, Shields, Swords and Fists skill which is a formidable line up of weapon skills. Later on when you evolve into a Treasure Hunter you acquire the Hand Guns skill also.

As far as related skills go, all three classes have a Salvage ability which is available on the loot screen after killing a monster, Salvaging like Soul Trapping and Skinning destroys the corpse of the monster. Salvaging is linked to Deconstruction, it can be used to gain a few trinkets and other items from corpses that you may have otherwise not gained. Also the Treasure Hunter can get treasure maps from Humanoids and Undeads and the Archaeologist can acquire Ancient Dungeon Keys.

All of these classes gain a bonus to the amount of money you acquire when looting monsters, the bonus starts at 10% and by the time you are an archaeologist it has gone up to 30% which means you can make a nice extra amount of money.

The Adventurer class gets Track Dungeons which provides a skill similar to track items and track resources you can use the World > Track > Dungeons screen to locate dungeons at a required level range. It lists all dungeons and not just the ones listed on the landmarks screen.

The Archaeologist class gets a skill called Archaeology which provides a mixture of equippableÂ and display type items, for more information on this skill see the Archaeology skill help topic.
