So you want some cool armor or weapons or maybe want to live in something better than a tent. Trouble is you don't have the skill or plans to make the cool stuff you want. So where do you get it? The craft marketeer of course.

What exactly is the craft marketeer? Basically it's a way you  can get any player who has the necessary skill to make an item for you - whether they are online or not. All you have to do is provide the materials at the level you want the item made.

This guide is intended to teach you how to use the marketeer to get the items you want.

To get items crafted, go to a Marketeer NPC (the easiest to find is the one at Springlade) - click on the marketeer and then click on the "craft" button. You will see a search box where you type in the name of the item you want; or part of the name. For example, if you type in "Halberd" and click "find" you will see a list of different halberds that can be crafted for you.

Next you select the specific item you want and on the right hand window pane you will see the minimum level you need to be to equip the item and two buttons. "Info" will give you information about the item stats and "components will show you what materials you need.

To get the item made, click on "components". You will see a window with two panes. The right pane shows you the materials and quantity you need. The left pane shows what materials you have. If the materials in the left pane are green, you have the right material and quantity. Click on the material for the level you want and it will turn green in the right pane. When all the materials and tools on the right are green, you will get an "OK" button.

Click on this to bring up a list of people who can make the item. Select the player and then click "make". This will cost some money but in most cases is much cheaper than buying it. After you click "make" the item is sent to your trade queue - refresh your queue and when it's done the item will go to your backpack ready to be equipped to impress your friends and foes.
