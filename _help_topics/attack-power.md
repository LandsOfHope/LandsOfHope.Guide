The attack power skill represents your ability to deal physical damage, while most races and professions start with some limited natural attack power the bulk of your **ATTACK POWER** rating will come from wielding weapons.  
  
The higher the skill the more damage you can potentially deal.  
  
**Formula**  
Damage Dealt + (ATTACK POWER / 20)  
  
This skill is used in conjunction with your Weapon skills but is not limited to any one weapon type.  
  
_Your actual damage is limited by your DPR and any style you\`re using._
