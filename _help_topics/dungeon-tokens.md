Player dungeon tokens are a special bonus item gained from fighting in player created dungeons, for every monster you kill in a player owned dungeon there is a 2% chance that it will drop a dungeon/reward token this makes them quite a rare and sought after commodity.

These tokens can be redeemed inside player dungeons at prize chests for special prizes, any token can be used at any prize chest so if you find a token you can use it in any dungeon that has a prize chest so you are not limited to one prize chest.

There are five types of prize chests, one for armor, clothing, rings, cardsÂ and one for weapons ... the items given are not obtained anywhere else and one token is all that is needed to get one item, after using the token it is destroyed ... so you must gather as many tokens as you think you will need to get all of the special dungeon items you think you will want.

To find player dungeons use the World > Landmarks screen.

**Dungeon prize token buffs**  
There is a new NPC at 27, 17 Coldglen Border Town (KV) who has three trophy quests that require Dungeon prize tokens.

**Dingy Dungeons**  
Requirement: 1 dungeon token.  
Reward: +50xp bonus, +15armor for 6hours.

**Despicable Dungeons**  
Requirement: 5 dungeon tokens, level 150.  
Reward: +250xp bonus, +50armor for 8hours.

**Deadly Dungeons**  
Requirement: 10 dungeon tokens, level 850.  
Reward: +1000xp bonus, +500 armor for 24hours.

All the spells stack with existing experience bonus effects, but they do not stack with each other so you can not have the Deadly Dungeon and Despicable Dungeon rewards on at the same time.

They are repeatable quests, although I still recommend you use your tokens on prize chest items as they may give you longer benefits.
