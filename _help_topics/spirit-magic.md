The **Spirit Magic** skill is a class magic skill. The magic skill determines what spells you can learn from the spirit line of magic.

The following playable classes get the spirit magic skill:

*   Shaman

There are generally two categories of magic spells:

*   Combat castable
*   Out of combat castable

Spells in this magic line fall into both categories and include both in combat damage spells and out of combat buffs.

This magic skill also gets the ability to summon pets and the ability to make soul gems and trap spirits in soul gems.

_To learn more spells you need to find spell scrolls or visit a Spirit magic spell trainer who can teach you more spells._

**Trapping souls**  
The Spirit magic skill allows you to trap the souls of the monsters you kill and make full soul gems out of them from any empty soul gems you might have.

_To make empty soul gems you need the soul gem creation spell which can be learnt from the Spirit magic trainer in Coldglen. To get to Coldglen you will need Cold survival._

Soul gems can then be used to create permanent monster spawns inside the Lesser, Greater and ordinary spawn rooms which can be made inside buildings.

_See Transmigration for more information on soul gem uses._

To trap a soul click the **Soul Trap Corpse** button on the Loot screen after killing a monster.

If successful you will gain experience, a full soul gem and a **purple skill gain**.

**Formula**  
Spirit magic = ((Target Level \* 5) - 5)

_i.e. To Soul trap a level 10 monster you need 45 spirit magic skill ((10 \* 5) - 5)._

**Casting a damage spell**  
You can cast damage spells in combat in two different ways.

*   Click the cast offensive spell button
*   Click the cast readied offensive spell button

To cast a readied spell you must have first readied the spell, to do this go to the Abilities > Ready Spells screen and choose the spells you wish to ready.

To cast any spell in combat you need two main things:

*   Intelligence, this determines which spells you can cast regardless of how much mana you have.
*   Mana, mana is consumed when you cast spells you can only cast a spell if you have enough mana to do so.

After casting a spell you will gain a **purple skill gain**.

**Casting a spell outside of combat**  
You can cast buffs or summon spells outside of combat by going to the Abilities > Spellbook screen.

Use the icons at the top of the screen to choose which spell line you wish to cast spells from. 

Selecting a spell by clicking on it will show several buttons on the right of the screen including:

*   Cast on me, lets you cast the spell on yourself.
*   Other, lets you choose who to cast the spell on if the spell can be cast on more than just you.

After casting a spell from your spellbook you will gain a **purple skill gain**.
