The **Bejeweling** skill is a crafting skill that can be learnt only by those people that have purchased the Uncharted Wars expansion pack. Seek out the trainer in Paradise Island at 49, 48.

This skill allows you to craft specialÂ items that can be fitted to existing items that equip to the neck, earring and finger slots.

Unlike patchcrafting, fitting upgrades to an existing item will add new stats and abilities depending on the upgrade you are adding.

_No plans are required for Bejeweling as you automatically have access to plans based on how high your skill is, this means the higher your skill the more plans you can use._

**Skill Use  
**Go to the Inventory > Tradeskill > Bejeweling screen and it will list all of the bejewels you can currently make. Unlike regular crafting skills you do not need to learn the plans for bejewling you will automatically be shown the available list of bejewels you can make based on your current skill.

Information on each bejewel is provided for you such as the type of slot item it will fit into and the effect and bonus gained from fitting the bejewel. Click the Make button to have your bejewel added to your queue. As with all the skills that use the queue you will not gain any experience or the items you are making until you visit the Inventory > Queue screen after the queue timer has run out.

Bejeweling requires one ingredient, a pearl . You can gather pearls as a bonus item gained from Marine Husbandry and they are only found in the Uncharted Waters expansion pack realm.

You will gain a **guaranteed skill gain** for each bejewel you queue.
