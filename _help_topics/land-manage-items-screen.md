The Manage Items screen is used to add and remove items on your land tiles.

Many of the available items that can be placed on land tiles are craftable although there are a few rarer items like the Monolith that are not obtained so easily.

To place an item you need to have the item in your inventory either on its own or as part of a stack. Select the item in the left window and there should be a Place button you can use to add the item to the tile.

If you wish to remove an item from a world tile repeat the procedure and click on the item on the left then choose the Remove button on the right of the screen.

Item colors:

*   **white**, you do not have any of these items in your inventory nor are any placed.
*   **red**, that item is currently placed.
*   **green**, you have one of these items in your inventory and none are placed.

_Note: Removing most world items will cause the item to be deleted from the game. The exception to this is some of the rarer items like the Monolith attempting to remove such an item will place it in your Trade Bag._
