**Bottom button bar  
**There are a few buttons at the bottom of the fight screen:

*   Flee Fight, the recommended button to use if you wish to leave a fight without dying or winning the fight. You may need to click it several times before you actually can leave as it involves a random check.
*   Recache, should you have a problem with the fight screen due to a game update or corrupt browser cache using this button should fix the problem.

**Combat casting tips**  
When casting a defensive/beneficial spell in combat the spell recipient will change from one of your enemies to either you or your pet. You can choose a specific target for a beneficial spell by clicking on the target in the left side of the window rather than the right as you would normally do with a combat offensive spell.
