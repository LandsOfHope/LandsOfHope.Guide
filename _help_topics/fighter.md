Allowed Armor: **Cloth Leather**  
The Fighter class has the following combat weapon skills to choose from:

*   Axes
*   Daggers
*   maces
*   Swords

You will get a sword and an axe automatically (if you do the Combat quest) you can also craft your own or buy weapons from General Store NPCs dotted around the lands of Myzan. Unlike the Archer class the Fighter class begins with the ability to dual wield weapons, this enables a fighter to wield a weapon in both hands and do more damage over time because of this. The Fighter class starts with the ability to use Leather as well as Cloth which puts it on an even footing with the Archer class and the Rogue class.

Attack Power: Good  
Magic Power: None  
Armor: Average  
Health: Average

**Fighting**  
After you have done the Training - Combat quest you will have gained some weapons, this section of the guide will focus on the use of the Axe and Sword in your Estate Supply Box rather than other weapons, although the information can be applied to most weapons.

As a fighter you can dual wield weapons, so you should equip both the axe and sword, dual wielding does not make you do twice as much damage as people who wield one weapon but it does make it so that your secondary weapon (right hand) is used randomly in combat giving you an added boost over someone using a one handed weapon.

As with all weapons making sure you have the best Axe and Sword for your level will ensure you do optimum damage, there are new materials generally every 5 levels so you should be able to upgrade your weapons every five levels, however there are not NPC shops every five levels so you may have to trade with other players or kill monsters or craft the items yourself to obtain them. The higher the level of the item the greater its DPR (Damage per round) rating and thus how much damage it can do.

After equipping your weapons, you can attack with them in combat. To attack an enemy in combat click the Attack button and you will swing at them.

**Crafting Swords (after you leave the Estate)**  
If you wish to be totally self sufficient you will need to make your own weapons for example a Sword, to do that you will need the following skills:

_Sword  
_Ingot (main ingredient) - Made from ore using the Blacksmithing skill, Ore is gathered using Mining  
Blade Hilt - Made from Ingots using the Blacksmithing skill, Ingots are made using Blacksmithing from ore gathered using Mining.

_Half-moon axe_  
Ingot (main ingredient) - Made from ore using the Blacksmithing skill, Ore is gathered using Mining  
Small Axe Handle - Made from Planks using the Carpentry skill, Planks are made using Carpentry from logs gathered using Lumberjacking.

So as you can see to make a sword you need Mining and Blacksmithing, and to make a half-moon axe you need Mining, Blacksmithing, Lumberjacking and Carpentry.

However while the initial list is long, the main ingredients used in the creation of both types of weapons is metal, which means that basically you only need Mining and Blacksmithing the other skills required can all just be trained and forgotten about as long as you have Mining and Blacksmithing and keep them at your maximum you will always be able to make a good axe and a good sword for your level.

Incase you werent aware the main ingredient in crafting, usually shows up in bold text or in gold text and it is the ingredient that determines the final level of the item you are making, so if you use a level 10 ingot in your sword you get a level 10 sword the level of the other ingredients doesnt matter you can use level 1 materials for those which is why you only need to have trained the other skills to be able to make the weapons yourself.

It is possible to skip some of these skills and get other players to make components for you, or to get other players to make your weapons.

**Future Choices  
**As a fighter at level 50 you can evolve into one of three professions:

1.  Grunt
2.  Squire
3.  Warrior

Evolution does not take away any skills, infact it gives you more skills and higher stats when you level however you should understand the differences between each profession before evolving so you dont later on decide you made a mistake.
