Auras were added in November 2008, essentially a new equipment slot called "Aura" was added along with 5 special aura items.

*   Aura of the Generous (Health and Experience Bonus)
    *   Gained as a trophy reward from the Genie Lantern building at 31, 59 (Available to all paid players)
*   Champions Aura (Health and Health Regen)
    *   Bought Extra Aura
*   Oracles Aura (Intelligence and Mana Regen)
    *   Bought Extra Aura
*   Vigors Aura (Stamina and Stamina Regen)
    *   Bought Extra Aura
*   Aura of Understanding (Health and Higher Experience Bonus)
    *   Bought Extra Aura

The 4 bought extra auras have higher stats than normal items, and provide an excellent addition to any players inventory.

To purchase one of these new Aura items go to File > Buy Extras > Amazing Items.
