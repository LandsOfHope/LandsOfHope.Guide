There is a new level 330 dungeon in Barren Downs at 81, 37 called the Tombs of the Muddy.

Legend has it that a town once sat at that location, the town was populated by a weird bunch of people who worshipped mud (yes you heard me MUD!). They bathed in it, drank it, swam in it, built houses out of it, made clothes out of it and generally used it for everything!

Well one day there was a horrid rain storm and their entire town was covered in a mudslide, obviously this was a traumatic event for the towns folk but they rather enjoyed it what with them being mud lovers and all and they believed their Mud god has decided to take them all to the great mud pool in the sky.

Anyhow a few of the inhabitants turned into zombies and other foul creatures and now roam the halls of what is left of their town.

The reward for entering the tombs and recovering a trophy item is a special polymorph item that will turn you into a High Elf.
