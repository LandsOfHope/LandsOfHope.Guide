One of the side benefits of capturing an island for your faction is the ability to establish a trade route. A trade route allows you to assign one of your vessels as a cargo ship to carry goods from the NPC on the captured island to your home base (be it the Pirate Enclave or Hunter Hold).

To establish a trade route, visit the Routemaster NPC on the island you captured, they will present you with options to allow you to setup your trade route, the amount of cargo you can transport depends on your vessel cargo size.

Some of the routes are more dangerous than others and it may be necessary to pay for certain extras to ensure your cargo arrives safely.

1.  Guards, If the route has a risk of attack it is advisable to hire guards. These will protect your cargo and ensure none of it is stolen by pirates, bandits or navy types out for a joy ride.
2.  Offerings, If the route has a risk of accident it is advisable to make offerings to the gods to ensure a safe and happy journey. If you do not any nature of things could befall your vessel.
3.  Other, Its wise to plan for the unexpected, for example if there is sickness aboard your vessel or simply some crew that feel the need to abandon ship or mutiny and take your cargo with you. Paying for other supplies may negate this risk.

While these extras will not always be necessary if you do not pay for them and you are unlucky enough to need them in the end you will end up losing some of your cargo and may not make a profit.

The NPC will show the cost of establishing this route and the profit you are likely to make, once a route is established you can not use that same vessel to make another route that day (but you may use other vessels if you have them), at Midnight the server will calculate your route and any random things that may happen and then determine how much cargo survived the journey and pay you accordingly.

You will receive notices about the success or failure of your trade route.

**Trade routes do not repeat, you will need to establish your routes each day as they will not automatically repeat to prevent people from farming a silly amount of money if they are not active.**
