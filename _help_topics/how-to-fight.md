This guide is intended as a basis for players on the estate, so the information portrayed here is specific to the estate.

It is assumed before you get into fighting that you have obtained your weapons and armor, or if you are a caster you have obtained your spells. If you have not done so please do so before starting a fight as it will go a lot easier if you do.

Fighting is fairly simple, you move to a tile that has a monster on it you then click on the monster and a turn based fight window is displayed with you on the left of the screen and your monster enemy on the right of the screen.

There are a bunch of combat options in the middle of the screen that are used to perform combat actions against your enemy.

The top line of the buttons is for physical actions like hitting your enemy with your melee or ranged weapons, the second line is for magical actions such as casting damage/defensive spells, the third line is for other actions such as consuming food/healing etc ...

If you are a Rogue or Fighter or Archer the only line of combat that you need be interested in right now is the top line. As your class is based around melee or ranged. Clicking the Attack button (first button on the top line) is all you need worry about as this will cause you to attack using whatever weapons you have equipped.

If you are a Caster the Cast Offensive Spell button is your best friend and is on the second row, if you are a Healer the Cast Defensive Spell button is what you use to cast your spells like Health Drain.

Druids get a mixture of spells and weapon skills so it may be best to experiment to find what works best for you.

After you click one of the buttons and take your turn, the monster gets to take its turn.Â  Whichever side gets to 0HP first will lose the fight.

If during the fight you need to get out of the fight or think you are going to lose and dont wish to die, you can click the Flee Fight button at the bottom, there is a 50/50 chance it will let you leave the fight.How to use the Interface?
