Aside from 50, 50 which is neutral, the following territory has been distributed evenly between the five factions:

*   Oceans, rivers and Lakes areas = Topaz Flight
*   Desert and Sand areas = Sunstone Flight
*   Grass and Woodland areas = Emerald Flight
*   Snow and Frozen areas = Diamond Flight
*   Mountain and Lava areas = Black Wing

If you are in your own territory i.e. an Emerald Flight member in a wooded area you will not see Emerald dragons instead you will see Emerald wurms. This is to prevent people farming monsters of their own faction. The wurms can be killed and provide wurmscales which can be turned in for rewards etc ....

You are free to enter another factions territory and slaughter the dragons you find their as much as you want without fear of retribution so let the mad dragon slaughtering fun begin!
