For the Christmas 08 event you can perform quests for Oldman Wintersvale and he will reward you with a Wintersvale deluxe gift box.

This box will contain one of seven random items:

*   Red nosed reindeer (pet)
*   Ilandria trading card (rare card)
*   Wintersvale voucher (worth pp)
*   Decorated white tree (tile decoration)
*   Decorated snowy tree (tile decoration)
*   Wintersvale scarf (toy snatching item)
*   Wintersvale bracelet (toy snatching item)
*   Curious Key (Unlocks another dungeon)
*   Chocolate Deccy Statue (tile decoration/museum decoration)

There are at least 5 quests with these boxes as rewards but their is no guarantee you will be able to get all of these items or the items you want because some of them are not-tradeable.
