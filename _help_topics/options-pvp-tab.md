**Auto-fight script**  
You can specificy the fight script to use during PvP scripted encounters or in situations where you might not be fully in control of your own character such as making a move with a pet instead of your character.

There are a bunch of different scripts to choose from too many to explain in any detail here, each script has been hand crafted to suit a class or specific style of play.
