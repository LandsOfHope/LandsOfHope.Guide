 **![Lone Joe](game/r/big/pirate11.gif)**

**Joseph \`Lone Joe\` Malone  
**Lone Joe is the leader of the Pirates, while many pirates do not always follow his leadership its nice to have someone to blame should the cookies hit the fan, so to speak. He is also the guy to see to turn over Navy Insignia to gain fame and your rewards.

 **![Mad Mary](game/r/big/pirate12.gif)**

**Marie \`Mad Mary\` Bonnie  
**Mad Mary is Joe\`s right hand woman, she deals with a lot of stuff that Joe just can\`t handle and she is also the promoter for the pirates. So if you feel like you deserve getting promoted hop along and speak to her. She may also have a few quests for you to do to improve your standing.

 **![Ned](game/r/big/pirate3.gif)**

**Ned the Surgeon  
**As a pirate I can strongly recommend either dying from your wounds, or not getting wounded at all ... the alternative would be to have Ned treat you and well you do not want to see what goes for hygiene in Ned\`s world.

 **![Nerry Dowell, Innkeeper](game/r/big/uwnd.gif)**

**Nerry Dowell  
**Nerry owns the Wexing Wench tavern, he has many a tale to tell you of his time as one of the leaders of the pirate league. He may also sell you some booze or what passes for booze in these parts.
