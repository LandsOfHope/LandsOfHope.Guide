The **Geology** gathering skill alllows you to gather gem resources. Gem resources are used in alchemy and may also be used in stonemasonry. Anyone can take up geology as it is a trainable skill regardless of class.

**Skill Trainer Location  
**Gunda Rocktoes at 14, 53 in Knotwood Valley

**Finding Gems  
**To gather gems you must first find a deposit of gems. This can be done with use of the World > Resources screen, visit this screen then click the gem button on the right of the screen to have it display a list of gem resources in the immediate area you have enough skill to gather.

If nothing shows up try using the white arrow buttons to move the displayed area around, if you have recently learnt the skill or your skill is not very high you may find you have to recall back to Springlade (31, 59) and then use the screen so that you find the lowest skill requirement resource..

Once you have found a gem resource on the resources screen click on it to travel to its location. The gem will show up in the bottom right corner of the game window.

**Formula**  
Skill Required = (Resource Material Level \* 5)

_i.e. To gather a level 5 gem you need 25 skill (5 \* 5)._

There are no skill gains from using the World > Resources screen, the skill gains for this skill come from the act of mining which is explained later on.

**Gathering the precious gems**  
To gather the gems on a tile, click on the gem icon that is visible in the bottom right corner of the game window. If you do not see a gem icon you are either in the wrong spot or the gem has not yet respawned.

As with all of the gathering skills you will need a tool, in this case a gem hammer, if you do not have any suitable tool you will be shown a screen which lists all of the tools that can be used to fulfill the requirement.

Once you meet the requirements you can try again and it will take you straight to the actual gathering screen.

The gathering screen contains relevant information relating to the resource you are trying to gather. Such as:

*   Level of the resource
*   XP you will receive
*   Skill requirement
*   Your current skill
*   Queue time
*   How many resources are left at the location

There are two buttons below this information.

*   Mining, gather 1 resource and send it to the queue. You will stand a chance of a **green skill gain** per gather and the amount of resources on the tile will go down by 1.
*   All, gather all resources in one go and send them to the queue, you will stand a chance of a **green skill gain** but only one and not one for each resource that was present. Using all will also take 5 seconds longer.

Both buttons give experience and both buttons use the queue system. It is recommended you use the first button unless you are in a hurry and need resources over skill gains and experience.

Use the Inventory > Queue screen to receive your resource and experience when the time is up.

_Once all the resources have been used up it will take up to five minutes for them to respawn again._
