Death is not permanent nor overly harmful it was never intended to be so either. I realise to many this style of game is hard to grasp and some people may die countless times in the pursuit of learning to play so I did not want to overly penalise players and risk losing players simply because they didnt grasp the basics from an early level.

When you die your mini-map screen will turn to grayscale or as some people refer to it black and white. There is nothing wrong with your computer when that happens it is merely intended to demonstrate you are dead and walking around as a ghost.

Bringing yourself back to life can be done in the following ways:

*   **Visiting a Healer**, click on a Healer (either a Player, NPC or Pet will do it) to be brought back to life.
*   **Shrine of Life**, this is a world item that can sometimes be found inside buildings and dungeons and is also evident inside the estate as an alternate way to get brought back to life.
*   **Resurrection Spell**, another player who has the resurrection spell can cast it on you to bring you back to life.

There are a few rules that come into play when you are brought back to life:

*   Dying outside and being brought back to life outside, your ghost form will jump back to the square you died on.
*   Dying inside and being brought back to life inside, your ghost form will jump back to the room you died in.

_Aside from the inconvenience of having to go get brought back to life there is no physical penalty for dying._
