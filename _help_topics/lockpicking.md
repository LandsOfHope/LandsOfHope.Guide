The **Lockpicking** skill is used to open locked containers and locked rooms inside NPC dungeons. You can use it to unlock items such as Battered Chests. This skill is a class skill which Rogues start with but no other classes acquire.

**Skill Use  
**In addition to the two methods explained below you can raise your skill by unlocking training boxes, and also by attempting to unlock special training boxes found dotted around the lands (inside some explorable buildings).

**Unlocking Dungeon Rooms  
**To unlock a locked NPC dungeon room, equip a lockpick and go stand adjacent to the room. The locked room must be either directly north, south, east or west. Once next to a locked room click the equipped lockpick icon at the bottom of the screen.

_You can only pick the locks of specific rooms inside NPC dungeons. These rooms generally contain shortcuts to access other parts of a dungeon, extra treasure chests and in some cases special bosses._

You will gain bounty for lockpicking NPC dungeon rooms, and if successful you will move into the locked room automatically. You can then access the locked room for 10minutes without needing to pick the lock again. No one else can access the room unless they also have Lockpicking.

**Formula**  
Lockpick = (Dungeon Mastery / 5)

_i.e. If you have 50 Lockpicking you have a chance of getting a skill gain by using a level 10 lockpick._

You gain experience through unlocking buildings as well as bounty and a **guaranteed skill gain**.

**Unlocking Items**  
You do not need a Lockpick to unlock a locked item. To unlock an item goto the Inventory screen click on the item and click Unlock. The Unlock screen will then be displayed giving you a list of all of the locked items in your inventory and letting you unlock them individually.
