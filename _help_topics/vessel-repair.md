Vessel repair is done in two places:

*   In combat
*   Out of combat

**In combat**  
During combat click on the "repair" button to have the selected ship repair itself for the next round. This will repair your ship based on its repair skill.

**Out of combat**  
If your vessel is disabled in combat the only way to fix it is to go to your Property > Vessels screen, click on the vessel and click Repair. This requires no skill and fixes the vessel instantly at no cost.
