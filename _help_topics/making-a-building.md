First of you must pick the building you wish make so go to the library>buildings menu.  Use this place to pick your building.  When you have finished this travel to a markeeter and search under his crafting menu by typing in that building (ex.ice shop deed).  When you have found the building you are trying to get click on it and look to the right side of that screen it should say components and info under the item you clicked on.  Click on components this will tell what you need to give to the markeeter to allow him to make the deed.  Once you have obtained those items take them back to the markeeter and give them to him/her he will make your deed and once the deed is done you will be able to place it just about anywhere. But some places are player/NPC owned so they are off limits also the small area around any town will sometimes be off limits too.
