THE GAME  
GM=Game Master.  The people who made the game.  Decius and Tekka are the only Game masters.

MOD=  Moderator.  This is someone chosen by Decius himself to control the chat box.  These people deserve your respect.

FHO, FH:o, or similar= Forlorn Hope: Online.  This is the game that Decius (who made LoH) made first.  LoH is considered a newer version of this one by some.

FES= Forlorn Explorer Standard.  The standard browser Decius made to play LoH in.

FEA= Forlorn Explorer Advanced.  The advanced browser for this game.

PK= Player Kill (or player killer, depending).  Mostly self explanatory.  It means either someone was killed by someone or did kill someone.

Queue= A character's tradeskill queue.  This shows and controls commands your character does that are not completed instantly.  The queue timer goes off when it empties.

Lag= game lag.  When the game takes longer to load than usual.

REALMS  
Estate= The area for new players to learn the game.

KV= Knottwood Valley.  This is the realm (part of the world) players begin in. (after the estate)  It is set up for levels 1-100

SB= Sandydale Basin.  The second realm.  Set for levels 100-200.

RS= Riverscape.  The third Realm.  Levels 200-300.

BD= Barren Down.  The fourth Realm.  Levels 300-400. (rarely heard this one referenced)

LV= Lakeview.  The fifth realm.  Levels 400-500.  (rarely heard this one referenced)

3G= Three Glaciers.  The Sixth Realm.  Levels 500-600.  (I've only heard this referred once, so if this isn't the norm, and you know it, let me know.)

CB= Coldbreeze.  The seventh realm.  Levels 600-700.  
   \*there are other realms, but I've never heard them referenced -at all-, so I'll leave them out until someone corrects me.\*

  
TOWNS  
\-It is important to note that the tile a town is on is not the actual town.  It is more like the outskirts.  To actually enter a town, you have to click on it on the main screen.  (It will be on the right half, in the center of the screen)

SG= Springlade.  The town new players start in once they leave the estate.  Located at 31, 59.

CG= Coldglen.  The snow town.  Located at 22, 13.

NG= Northglen.  A town in the first map, between SG and CG. Located at 27, 47.
