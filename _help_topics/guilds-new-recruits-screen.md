The new recruits screen is used to manage your new guild members and provides the same functions that the main members screen provides except this screen only shows the newest members of the guild who have not been promoted to a proper rank yet.

_New recruits have restricted access to features so it is recommend you either promote a new member past the -1 rank or kick them out of the guild if you do not plan on having them as a member._

You can use the members screen to perform the following:

*   **Promote**, promote a member to a higher rank. This is done simply by selecting a member then clicking on a new rank on the list of titles to the right of the screen.
*   **Demote** , demote a member to a lower rank. This is done simply by selecting a member then clicking on a new rank on the list of titles to the right of the screen.
*   **Message**, send a message to a member. This is done simply by selecting a member then clicking the PM button.
*   **Kick**, kick a member from your guild. This is done simply by selecting a member then clicking the kick button.
*   **Transfer**, transfer the guild to another member. This is done simply by selecting a member then clicking the Transfer button.

For larger guilds there is a search box at the top of the screen which will let you search for specific members or you can use the page numbers at the top of the screen to move between pages.
