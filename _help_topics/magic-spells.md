**About Spells  
**There are a number of magic skills in the game, each one of these magic skills has a number of magic spells. The skills and therefore spells that are available to you depend on your class and future class evolutions. For a full list of all of the spells in the game please look at the Library > Spells.

**Spells are typically the only weapon magic uses have in a fight, although some magic users do not get truly offensive spells they have spells that are used for other purposes.**

Spells can be gained through two methods:

*   Using a scroll
*   Visiting a trainer

Scrolls are random drop loot items that you may gain from killing monsters or buying/trading with other players. A scroll is a piece of paper that you can use from your Inventory screen and it will teach you the spell it is for.

Trainers are the most common way to get new spells as there are trainers in every realm, typically trainers may teach spells for several different skills. You can visit a trainer and pay to learn new spells. To find the location of a spell trainer use the Help > Manual > Realm Name guide pages to look up the skill you are seeking more spells for. 

Trainers only show you the spells they can teach that you currently have enough skill to use so you can not stock up on all the spells in the game in one go, and you may need to visit several spell trainers in each realm to get all the spells that are available.

You will need sufficient skill to learn the spell, you may only learn spells you have the skill for.

After learning a spell it will become available in combat assuming you meet two other criteria:

*   Required intelligence
*   required mana

_Most likely if you learn a new spell but can not use it in combat it is because you do not have enough intelligence or mana to use it. You can check how much is needed on the Abilities > Spells screen._

**Readying Spells  
**You can speed up combat by readying your favourite spells, this allows you to reduce the amount of clicking needed to cast your spells. A total of 20 spells across all skills can be readied so it is important you choose wisely.

To ready a spell go to Abilitles > Ready Spell choose your magic skill at the top of the screen then ready all of the spells you think will be useful to you in a fight.

_You may find it makes sense to ready every fourth or fifth spell as you will find that when you use a spell the mana usage makes it so your next highest spell can not be used._

When in combat to use a readied spell click the **Cast readied offensive spell** or **Cast readied defensive spell** buttons instead of the usual button you may use. If you wish to choose a spell then simply go back to using the **Cast offensive spell** and **Cast defensive** spell buttons.

**Using Spells**  
Spells can be used in one of two ways.

*   Readied, see above section.
*   Selected, see below section.

If you are not using readied spells you will find that when you click the offensive and defensive spell  buttons you are presented with a list of spells you can use. The highest 25 or so spells that you have the requirements to use are displayed with the most powerful ones from left to right. You can simply choose a spell to use that spell.

Each time you use a spell your mana will go down, if it goes down far enough so that the requirements for a spell are no longer met you will find the list of spells changes to show weaker spells or that you start using a weaker readied spell.
