2) How do I get the taming skill?/tame a pet?  
  
Only certain professions are able to tame things.  
  
Warlords tame Humanoids with Slavery (Fighter > Warrior (Level 50) > Berserker (Level 350) > Warlord (Level 650))  
Beastmasters tame Beasts with Beastmastery (Archer > Scount (Level 50) > Beastmaster (Level 350), or Archer > Tracker (Level 50) > Hunter (Level 350) > Beastlord (Level 650))  
Necromancers tame Undead with Necromancy (Caster > Shaman (Level 50) > Necromancer (Level 350))  
Warlocks tame Demons with Demonology (Caster > Invoker (Level 50) > Summoner (Level 350) > Warlock (Level 650))  
Druids tame Plants with Druid Magic (Hermit > Diviner (Level 50) > Warden (Level 350) > Druid (Level 650))  
Druids tame Insects with Druid Magic (Hermit > Diviner (Level 50) > Warden (Level 350) > Druid (Level 650))

The Hermit > Druid line is a bought extra profession which can be gained with the Jurrasic Wars Expansion Pack for 15USD/3HC.

_Myth and Legends_ is only accessable through items.

_Ethereal Trappings_ is only accessable by buying the new bought extra _Ethereal Bindings_ for $10USD/2HC.

  
All of these are listed on the Library>Professions>Profession Evolution list in the game menus.  
  
If you do not have the skill you cannot do it unless you have an item that gives you the skill.
