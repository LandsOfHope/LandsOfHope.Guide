If you have been given a code either because you purchased HCs or because you won a prize or other cool bonus you need to know how to redeem them.

Take the code you were given (or check your email for the code) then go to your Account screen, there is a Redeem Code box that you can then paste/type the code into and click the Redeem button.

Your HCs will then be credited to your account and the code consumed.
