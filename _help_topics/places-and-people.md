The Afterlife contains the following important groups:

**The Undead**  
Farm from all being evil or horridly deformed Undeads can be rather friendly ... upon death all spirits end up in the Afterlife as raw energy, sometimes they manifest themselves as evil entities (monsters) and sometimes as nice entities. Once in a while abnormalities in the stream cause evilness to manifest itself in quantity and this is what led to the Reapers ...

**Darkness**  
An entity made up of thousands of life spirits bound together in hatred, it is this entity that is corrupting the lifestream and creating the Reapers.

**Templar**  
The Knights Templar is a holy order originally created by a religious order but now fully independant, the Knights Templar were on a holy quest into the promised land to find the Grail (a treasured relic) they all disappeared ....
