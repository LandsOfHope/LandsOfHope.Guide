You can call this an Addon to Decius\`s "Optimizing Computer Performance" if you wish.

The reason your computer may lag is because your TIF\`s (Temporary Internet Files) have been swamped from LoH. You accumulate ALOT of TIF\`s from LoH it self. You accumulate 1 page when the chat refreshes. The chat refreshes every 15 seconds. So that\`s a total of 4 TIF\`s a minute. So if you were on the game an hour, you would get 240 pages. Let\`s assume you play the game for 12 hours a day, that\`s 2880 pages already. Now you have to add on everytime you sent a message in the chat. Let\`s say you accumulate an extra 1120 pages from talking in chat. That\`s 4000 pages there. This gives you 28000 pages a week. Then comes every screen in the game, assuming you use most of them...This is why it\`s important to clear your TIF\`s on a daily basis.

To clear your TIF\`s, open a new Internet Explorer browser. Click on Tools at the top, then Internet Options. When a new window opens, look for "Delete Files". Another box will open up asking if you\`re sure you want to delete your files, click yes. Depending on how many you have, it may take a while to clear them all or not long at all.

One more reason could be that your RAM is being used up by other programs. This can be helped by closing several RAM draining programs. (This is already explained in Decius\`s topic)

If you find your RAM is still being used up, then I recommend you download FreeRam XP Pro that will help free up your RAM and make your computer less laggy. You can download it at [http://www.yourwaresolutions.com](http://www.yourwaresolutions.com/) and it is very useful to free RAM.

One more reason I find is that your computer has been left on for a long time (depending on the computer you have, mine is slow and needs a restart every day or two). So if you find lag after trying my ideas and Decius\`s, restart your computer to see if that helps.
