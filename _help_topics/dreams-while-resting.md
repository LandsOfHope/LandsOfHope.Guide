Ok, we all have to rest, World>>Rest, to fill all stats from time to time.

When we do, random dream events happen.

**In your dreams you see a distant time when the lands were rich and bountiful but you sense trechery afoot as you are drawn to a cloaked figure walking out into the woods with a spade.**

**He digs a hole and buries a chest in a place he hopes no one will find it.Â   
As you awaken you hastily draw down the places and things you saw in your dream and decide to go find whatever it was.**

Congratulations, you gain a treasure map, check your inventory for it, then go get a spade(general store) equip it, and the mining skill and go dig that treasure up!

You think of your parents and wonder if they are proud of the path you have chosen. Your mother appears to you and tells you how much she loves you You feel warm and fuzzy all over. (no special effects)

**You dream of your parents and your family, who are all but a fading memory of your life. You recall your childhood spent playing in the fields around your home with your trusty pet and the times you and your friends got up to mischief. You feel as if you have regained lost memories.**
