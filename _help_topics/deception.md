_It may also be obtained from bonuses on items._

When you disguise an item the name of the item is changed from what it actually is to something different. Infact a whole different picture and name is picked from a similar series of items. You will gain a **purple skill gain** from a succcessful use of this skill however you do not gain any experience.

_You will need to appraise the disguised item using appraisal or via an appraisal NPC to use the item again. This makes disguise a great companion skill for people wishing to raise appraisal._

**Formula**  
Deception required = (Item Level \* 5)

_i.e. To disguise a level 10 item you will need 50 deception skill._
