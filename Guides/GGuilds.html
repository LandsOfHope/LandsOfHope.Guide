Guilds require a lot of time and effort to make work, but when they do work it is truly a wonderful feat !<bt><br>
Guilds are a body of players that have chosen to align themselves together, most likely with common ideals and goals in mind.<br><br>
While guilds can be very beneficial to members, a guild is not about one member it is about all members, so you should not just join a guild for the rewards or to make the biggest guild in the game as these reasons dont really make for the best experience.<br><br>
When making a guild, there are a number of things that need to be setup, in particular Titles, a guild title probably known as a rank in most other games can be assigned to a member or groups of members and grants them permissions in the guild.<br><br>
Its probably best to come up with your guild titles on paper and when you are happy with them transfer them to the game, I would recommend around 10 titles to start with, with various different permissions ... you can also make custom titles for specific players who do well for the guild or deserve recognition.<br><br>
<table class='weakcell'><tr><td colspan=2><b>Rewards and Quests</b></td></tr>
<tr><td width=280 valign=top><img src='/images/GuildNPC.jpg'></td><td valign=top>To use a guild reward you have to visit a Guild Rewarder NPC, there is usually at least 1 such NPC per map and typically near the first town of the map.<br><br>These rewarders show a list of guild rewards that have been unlocked ... if the NPC does not show any rewards its likely that no one has unlocked any recently.<br><br>To unlock rewards yourself and not rely on others doing it you have to take quests from the Guild Questor NPC.<br><br>When you complete a quest it gives you guild fame, the more guild fame you have the more quests you can do, sometimes you will have to repeat various quests to get more guild fame.<br><br>You will only get guild fame if the quest your doing has not been unlocked by another member of the guild recently.<br><br>Once a reward has been unlocked it is accessible to everyone in the guild who can use it, and it lasts for a few hours or until the rewarder runs out. In which case you need to do the quest again.<br><br>When the time limit runs out, you get to keep the item but if someone wants to get the same reward it has to be unlocked again.</td></tr>
</table>

<table class='weakcell'><tr><td colspan=2><b>Trophies</b></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top colspan=2>Located in the same room as a Guild Rewarder NPC is usually a Guild Trophy Collector NPC, these work slightly differently to the Reward system but ultimately lead to you and your guild getting access to bonus items.<br><br>The Trophy Collector NPC requires that you collect items and return them to him/her when you have enough items the collection is completed and a special standard is unlocked (depending on which trophy you completed), you also get guild fame for returning items.</td></tr>

You can use the Guild > Manage screen to edit the members and promote them accordingly.</td><td width=280 valign=top><img src='/images/GuildMember.jpg'></td></tr>

This makes it so that only members of your guild can enter them and they become great places for the guild to meet or for guild members to craft items or store items in chests etc ...<br><br>To make a room or building a guilded property use the A (Administer) button when standing inside the room, then you should have the option to make the room Guilded or if it already is Guilded you can Unguild it.<br><br>Once a room or building is guilded you can view its location via Guilds > Property.</td></tr>
