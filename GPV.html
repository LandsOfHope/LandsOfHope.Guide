Player Vendors are Pets that sell your goods to other players, they can do this in the format of a shop i.e. a player comes to your building and buys directly from the npc (if the building is unlocked and accessible) they can also sell your goods via the Marketeer system.<br><br>
The Marketeer system is managed by NPCs, a player visits a Marketeer NPC and can then browse every single item for sale and being held by player vendors.<br><br>
A player vendor can not be put just anywhere, you have to have a shop room in your building, or be given a shop room in someone elses building.<br><br>
To spawn a shopkeep click the "A(dminister)" button at the bottom of the screen and you should see a screen like the following:

<br><br>
If you do not see the Shopkeep options, you are not inside a shop room.<br><br>
<table class='weakcell'><tr><td colspan=2><b>Hire Shopkeep</b></td></tr>
<tr><td width=280 valign=top><img src='images/PVHire.jpg'></td><td valign=top>This screen allows you to hire a generic shopkeeper to run your shop for you, or to hire a shopkeeper that someone else is selling.<br><br>By default the Human shopkeepers are always shown, however you can also try searching to see if any players are selling any other vendors.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<table class='weakcell'><tr><td colspan=2><b>Move Shopkeep</b></td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top colspan="2">The move shopkeep screen is very similar to the hire screen, except it shows a list of all of the shopkeepers you own that are not in this room.<br><br>You can choose a shopkeeper and have it moved to this location.</td></tr>
</table>
<br><br>
The moment you get a shopkeeper it starts selling, so be warned. Do not use a shopkeeper as storage as you may find the items you put on it were bought by another player.
<br><br>
<b>Stocking the Shop</b><br>
A shop is nothing without priceless merchandise to sell, you need to stock your shopkeeper by hand. Any item you own can be placed on the shopkeeper and it will sell it, trade the items to the shopkeeper using the Character > <a href='GTrading.html'>Trade screen</a> or trade button.<br><br>
I would recommend pricing your goods before trading them to your shopkeeper, or you can do it afterwards, however if your prices are cheap you may find the item is sold before you got to adjust its prices.<br><br>
<b>Pricing Goods</b><br>
Pricing goods can be done via the Inventory > Actions > Price screen or if you have traded the goods already it can be done via the Minions > Manage screen.<br><br>
This screen shows a list of all your items and lets you enter the price you wish to receive for the item, the price you enter does not change the value of the item when selling it to an NPC merely the price when a player is buying the item from you via the shopkeeper.<br><br>
You can enter any price, you could enter some crazy high price to stop someone from buying the item but you may find if its on a shopkeeper it gets sold anyway.<br><br>
When pricing goods the price you enter is the price of the entire stack and not an individual item, so if you have a stack of 10 arrows and enter a price of 10gp, you will not be getting 10gp per arrow you will get 10gp for the 10 arrows.
<br><br>
Any money the shopkeeper makes is immediately put into your held funds, and you will not get a message when a sale is made as that could be thousands of messages per day, however every 24 hours a sale status message is sent summarizing your sales, you can use the Character > Statistics > Sales screen to read up on your sales and see where you are making the most money.
